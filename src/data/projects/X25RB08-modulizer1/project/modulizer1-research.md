# The Modulizer Phase 1: Defining the Shape

**Researcher:** Agustin Salinas
**Research Type:** Mid-Level Literature Review (approx. 60 hours)

## Research Premise

This research investigates the energy and design implications of massing strategies in sustainable school architecture. Through comparative literature reviews and precedent analysis, it evaluates the tools and methods used by Lake|Flato and Overland for early design-stage sustainability modeling. By identifying proven massing modifications from CAE and COTE award-winning schools, this work will inform a design strategy for Kennedy Elementary that balances exterior modesty, energy performance, and site safety for outdoor learning.

## Introduction

This research, *The Modulizer Phase 1: Defining the Shape*, investigates massing strategies and early-stage energy modeling tools that inform sustainable design. Through a comparative literature review and precedent analysis, the study examines how design firms integrate energy modeling into the conceptual and schematic design stages.

Three modeling tools - Sefaira, Autodesk Forma, and Solemma Climate Studio - were evaluated for their usability, accuracy, and integration with existing design workflows. Sefaira and Climate Studio were found to be most effective for early and mid-stage energy and daylighting analysis, while Forma offered broader site-based assessments but lacked energy modeling capability.

The study further analyzed award-winning sustainable projects - Alice West Fleet Elementary School, John Lewis Elementary School, and Coliseum Place Affordable Family Housing, among others - to identify proven massing and orientation strategies that enhance building performance. Key findings highlight the value of east-west orientation, roof and facade optimization, and integrated photovoltaic systems in reducing energy use and improving daylight quality.

The research also applied these strategies through iterative simulations for Kennedy Elementary School, using Sefaira-based analysis to refine daylight and glare across seasons. Adjustments in shading and glazing led to measurable reductions in heat gain and improved daylight distribution.

**Sustainable Massing Strategies:**

1. **Roof Plane and Shape Optimization:** Using roofs that don't shade each other, concept design options were blocked and stacked with the sun, while keeping the principal parti axis east-west and minimizing the building footprint. The collection of the sun's photons became a major driver of form.

2. **Massing Optimization:** The two "arms of the Y" each had less than ideal solar orientation. The arm aligned with the street used mass timber with deep overhangs to produce shade, while the other arm fine-tuned the angle and size of its apertures and used custom shading solutions.

3. **Vertical Plane Glazing Optimization:** Each elevation was fine tuned to allow maximum daylight with minimal solar heat gain. Northwest facing classrooms "pushed out", allowing floor-to-ceiling glass to face due north, while southeast facing classrooms did the opposite.

## Kennedy Elementary Case Study

### Design Process

Using energy modeling and daylight analysis to evaluate a base design and inform design revisions. High-level DD interventions focused on:
- Reducing heat gain
- Reducing glare
- Improving seasonal daylighting
- Improving artificial lighting and spatial energy performance

### Analysis Areas:
- South-facing collaboration spaces and classrooms
- North-facing collaboration spaces and classrooms
- Central library and common space

### Simulation Schedule:
Heat maps delivered at 9am, 12pm, and 5pm across all seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter).

### Base Model Findings:
After base simulation was performed, results were handed off to the design team. Engaged in the iterative design process, modifications were made to the plan area, shared and collaboration spaces.

### Revised Model Results:
Strategic alterations were made in areas inline with design parameters:
- Problematic areas identified in terms of glare and high footcandle readings
- Sefaira inputs altered to provide design ideas to design team
- VLT (Visible Light Transmittance) adjustments made by zone
- Overhang extensions where impactful

## Conclusions

The findings of The Modulizer Phase 1 demonstrate that thoughtful design - grounded in data-driven modeling and precedent analysis - has a significant impact on the sustainability performance of educational facilities. By synthesizing lessons from CAE and COTE award-winning projects, the study confirms that strategic orientation and solar-responsive envelopes can lower energy consumption, mitigate glare, and enhance occupant comfort.

Applying these principles to Kennedy Elementary's design process revealed key daylighting and glare challenges within the current building configuration. The design team will use these findings - supported by iterative simulation data - to refine shading strategies, window placement, and material selections to improve visual comfort, energy efficiency, and overall building performance.

This research not only aligns with Kennedy Elementary's objectives but also establishes a transferable design methodology for future Pfluger projects such as Flour Bluff CTE and Cornerstone. Moreover, the study provides a foundation for collaboration with academic and industry partners, such as UTSA and SunWest, to advance evidence-based design research and publication.

Ultimately, this work underscores the importance of integrating early-stage performance modeling into architectural practice - bridging qualitative design intent with quantitative environmental outcomes - to achieve buildings that are both contextually sensitive and energy efficient.
