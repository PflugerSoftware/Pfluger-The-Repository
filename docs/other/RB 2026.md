**RB 2026-20260108_105835-Meeting Recording**

January 8, 2026, 4:58PM

2h 4m 55s

A*OK.\
RB RB.\
A*Yeah.\
A*I don\'t have anything to share here, just have meeting notes. So yeah,
I read your notes the other night. So OK, sweet. So I guess first one is
for setting this date for launching.\
So.\
A*I was proposing the end of January. Yep, right on. OK, so.\
Because yesterday, as you saw, we\'re trying to fine tune our budget.
A*Yep.\
We\'ll take that. That needs to be board approved.\
Which?\
I think it\'s going to the board on the mid January. So last day of the
month, somewhere around there is fine to watch this because we\'ll
already have vetted out.\
Dollars and cents, right? OK, so but in order for me to finish building
all this stuff, I gotta have the tools in order to do it. So those tools
you went over yesterday.\
A*Yes. And the ones that I emailed Craig and Austin with, I see you on
that one. So those we technically already have the budget for because
we\'ve already bought them and the other ones are just free, so.\
There\'s really no expense to incur on them, right? So if he can just
get those accounts set up, I can start working \'cause right now I\'m
just like completely flying blind. Yes, I am so far out of the loop on
all these conversations, there\'s like really no way for me to know
like.\
Who\'s doing what? Who to talk to? Who is pulling the strings? Who has
the permission to do what? So.\
I don\'t. I don\'t know who the I get. I get Gander. It\'s Craig is
doing all the IT stuff.\
Yes, and he reports to more.\
C*That\'s a consultant. But yeah, so. So any IT staff has to go through
him. Those are all those tools, all those accounts and whatnot. Yeah. So
I mean, he\'s sending that e-mail. Has he responded? No. So, but it\'s
like.\
A*I can\'t wait until like the last week and start working because it\'s
like right now I\'m already way behind schedule because I was like
trying to do this, I mean December and November and I was told to stop.
So it\'s like I can\'t.\
I don\'t know. So I don\'t know if we want to do January and then like,
is the board going to approve this stuff or is it going to be like
they\'re only approving a dollar amount? 
C*OK, so they\'re not going to
come out of it and be like, we don\'t have time to go through the
nuances of that. We need to talk about it some more.\
Because then it\'s February, March and then you might as well just do.
Yeah. So I mean, if it\'s just software and it\'s not implications of
cost, you should have that loaded already. So tell Craig and Austin
load, 
A*OK.\
C*Give you the rights. I mean, Lauren\'s not going to know.\
And she\'s expecting you to help drive that already. So that that\'s,
that\'s The thing is like there\'s anybody sitting around like Craig
loaded up. OK, right. Yeah. So I guess that goes, especially if it\'s
programs that don\'t cost anything or it\'s already in the budget.\
We could go ahead and start activate it going through that. OK, yeah. So
just follow up with him and be like talked with Christian this morning
to start getting going on the stuff. Good.\
Yeah, I mean, especially if there\'s no dollar implications. I mean,
it\'s just so for those, so like dollar, so.\
A*What I gained from that is pretty much anything over \$2000 is a spend
and anything under that is nothing.\
A*So all of this stuff, I mean, it\'s like 100 bucks a year. So is that
considered a cost that has to be approved by the board or is that
something that can be done before that?\
The Excel that we went through yesterday was to get us to a dollar
amount.\
C*Right. And then that dollar amount is then going into a bigger dollar
amount that is then going to the board.\
And so if it\'s a nuance of \$100 or whatever that\'s in that baked in
that, I think it\'s fine. I guess what I need to hear from you is what
are we buying and what are we not? What do you still need approval from?
What do you not that we didn\'t do yesterday?\
Nothing. I went over all the items, so all the items I went over it is
some of those items where they knew.\
Yeah, like a mix. Was it relatable to a big dollar amount? Less than
that, like \$2000 a year?\
So the the other one for that is like if it\'s not at a cost occurred at
once, yeah, that\'s over 12 months. So to get it started I think you\'re
looking at like 20 bucks. So for me it\'s kinda like.\
Is that\'s what\'s the holdup, Jack, you know? But then it\'s like, I
don\'t have any agency to say to do that, you know, because I\'m in a
position where I\'m just like kind of helping and advising. So it\'s
like I can\'t go to Craig and say, hey, I need to get the software
installed.\
A*Because then he\'s got to like get his stuff approved and everything. So
I don\'t. I\'m just not sure of like where who I guess that\'s why I\'m
talking to you about this because it\'s like you\'re you\'re on the
board. So it\'s like who can we go? I guess can we do this? Can we can
we get it installed or is it?\
A*Is it? I have to approve it by somebody else just so it doesn\'t create
like a situation, you know where it\'s like Alex is starting to install
stuff. Like why does he need to install stuff? Like we have this
process. 
C*Send an e-mail to Craig and Lauren and copy me. OK, don\'t be
able to think it.\
Yeah, \'cause it\'s like less than 2000 a year, like stupid. And to
start it up, you\'re you\'re looking at like 100 bucks. Yeah. So OK, so
just, yeah, get get the low hanging items, yes.\
A*OK, sweet. And then so for this one, for the internal launch and the
external launch, there\'s like the content approval process and I know
for all of the research that we did last year.\
We\'ve only put out the one from Catherine and Brayden, but there
there\'s all the other stuff. So what is the process then to get the
stuff approved to market? Is that just you and Cody or externally?\
Externally and internally. So I think right now for us, well, what what
do you have that needs to be externally communicated? Let\'s start
there. Anything.\
A*So it\'s our immersive learning, the mass timber, then our dashboards,
then the so dashboards I would not publicize.\
A*OK. 
C*I mean, you\'re going to be doing that with clients, right? Yeah. Is
that what you\'re thinking? You\'re not saying let\'s, let\'s go to
design and construction and start to publicize our 
A*no, no, no. 
So let me
C*bring this kid out of here, so.\
To answer your question, it would be a partnership with Cody. We are in
the process of hiring another marketing director.\
So once that person\'s on board and they can help us navigate. But I
would say we\'re at the beginnings of some new research projects. So at
the point they\'re ready to market. That\'s not really my main focus of
R&B. R&B is to quickly get it fed into the projects and then show those
outcomes. So I think we got a little.\
A little time. Brain\'s and Catherine\'s was a little different. It was
flipping it, right? It was an idea. So depending on what we get in the
applications, we can measure that. I\'m always hesitant of taking
anything publicly without showing.\
Or demonstrating outcomes.\
So is I think we got a little time. So I guess from that then is the no
like the no go point is it on the project? Because if the if we\'re
waiting for the research to be on a project realistically could be
waiting three years to to pick up the ideas, yeah.\
A*So do we want to revise that to be more loose?\
In terms of a research project, yeah, \'cause you end at different
levels, right? Well, so for instance, so like, here\'s, here\'s all
these, right? So you have modulizer Part 2. So this one is the.\
Energy analysis for Flour Bluff, right?\
If we\'re gonna wait until this is built to publish it, you\'re gonna
have to wait either until the project goes through, doesn\'t die, or
finally gets built and is occupied with final photos. So you you, I
mean, really, you mean, you\'ll wait three years.\
And so then you\'d have a whole backlog of like 80 things. Everything\'s
waiting to go.\
And just on like a point to like get people involved in this, you could
say like, Oh yeah, you\'re gonna work on this, but probably you won\'t
be able to talk about it, you know? So it\'s like maybe there\'s a
looser area to talk about things, to publish things because it\'s like
this is still such exciting stuff, you know, because you want to.\
Show your client. You want to have this out there saying like, no,
we\'re we\'re doing energy analysis on these buildings. We\'re doing
lighting analysis on these buildings. We\'re investigating mass timber.
Yeah. So I think there\'s like still ways to talk about this stuff
without it being built. So let me let me have.\
C*Let me help you. My help. This is the conversation I had with Heather.
So Heather\'s all about publishing the whole purpose.\
Of R&B.\
is to um hands.\
Now, what do we mean by enhance? Ultimately the work. Mm-hmm. Secondary
is an expertise.\
Right, so work first. Whatever we\'re researching should enhance the
work day one. I don\'t care about other things, but whatever that
research component is should ultimately start to feed.\
As best and as quickly as possible, work broadly or a specific project
or how we work process wise AI, right? We\'re barely tapping into that
as it relates to Logan, but what about specs? What about UNQC?\
Whatever, right? That\'s an RMB effort, but it ultimately.\
Makes the project better for our clients and then through that effort,
you\'re growing expertise.\
Way down here is the publication of that. I I don\'t. That\'s not the
whole premise of that. That\'s an outcome of making our work better. So
as it relates to that effort, that effort, that little seed on that one
project.\
That was created to that analysis should now start to spread to our
projects.\
C*And so I\'m less concerned about publishing something that we haven\'t
brought, we haven\'t brought consistency to, right? Because you don\'t
hear much about sustainability or energy modeling or stuff like that in
any of our offices.\
C*So the point of that or that one project should be now to spill into
Flower Bluff like we talked about and then open X. Now Corpus is
learning what that is. So next time Corpus is working on a project, it
starts to be a habit. So it\'s it\'s going up one.\
Off in the work and then it\'s to create habits. And then ultimately if
in some of this opportunity we get an opportunity to share out like I
don\'t, we\'ll have to pick and choose. Is there opportunity to share
our story? What are we doing different?\
C*Right. That was the Katherine and Braden. But I told Katherine quickly
get this in because right now it\'s this discussion in the cloud. That
doesn\'t really make you an expert based on what makes you an expert is
how you take this and enact on it, right. So I only say that first is so
publications and all that should be the last thing we\'re thinking
about.\
C*Because R&B is still somewhat new to this firm. We\'re growing the
muscles ultimately to make our work better. Second is to create experts
and then third is to show that out, right? Some of these instances you
can do this through, like I said, the work.\
But I I I think that should help in terms of your when you\'re looking
at these applications, how can we prioritize the effort which will also
help prior to our staff, all those other things we got to figure out
right the labor, but the way to make this work is to.\
It\'s research through the work as best as we can and then all this
other stuff just happens, right? I think for me with the Texas Architect
is to start to create that relationship and we don\'t have Sun West.\
Maybe we\'ll get them back, but creating that conduit, I published stuff
with them before without even having marketing. 
A*Can I go back to this?
C*Yes.   So we have this thing, this concept called.\
The repo, right? This is where all of the work and the expertise sharing
up. Yep. So this you can think of this the repo or the depo. This is
like a big container, yes, right.\
And we divide the container in half. Yeah. And part of our work lives in
both. Yeah. So we have our external and then our internal, right?\
What I need to know is where is this line?\
Because if, if, if it\'s all internal, that\'s perfectly fine because
that that still works because it\'s just like this. So someone can, you
know, get on here and they can go, oh, look at all this, this fun stuff,
you know, they can say, oh, one analysis. So I have my my different
options and everything.\
It\'s hard to answer it. I think it\'s going to be a case by case. So do
we want to start with everything? Yes, on the internal side. And so
it\'s in knowing, knowing we we will right size the push, right. But the
main focus day one is this and then we\'re going to seek, we\'re going
to seek those opportunities.\
Depending on what it is like like for that example, Kennedy, we\'re just
trying to get in the habit of talking about energy modeling and what\'s
that tool and at some point we\'re we\'re the we\'re the sustainability
guys because right now we we\'re not even talking about right.\
For that instance, now it\'s the reverse for Katherine and Braden. Now
it\'s to quickly get to that. So then they can come back to an external
presentation. Yeah, in two years to say, let\'s start that conversation
again and here\'s some work.\
Yeah. OK. So we\'re gonna start all on the internal side and then we
will decide then that\'s right, what comes over here. That\'s right. And
then these blocks can either shift to be equal, yes, on internal and
external or.\
Maybe like the dashboard is all internal and there\'s no external. Yeah,
correct. Because that\'s going to be, it\'s our baby, right? So that\'s
something you\'re not going to want to share off the world other than
put in your clients because we want to be the keeper of that. What was
the other example? So mass timber.\
We\'re not going to be able to publish anything as it relates to the
Mass Timber Book as we don\'t have anything.\
You could still, you could still demonstrate the thought leadership.
Yeah, but I think in terms of because for the competition, there\'s
plenty of big boys that have got stuck to show that have built. So
that\'s not anything new. It\'s great to show and talk about knowledge,
but when we don\'t have any substance.\
You\'ve heard the term greenwashing, right? When when LEED first came
out, there was a lot of greenwashing. I feel like it\'s a little bit of
that. We are trying to understand mass timber as it relates to helping
push.\
Projects. That\'s what the beauty about the nugget. We got the gym that
landed in our lap, right? So holy cow, we got a contractor pushing it,
so we\'re going to ride that wave. So when we do get that gym or
hopefully we can then we can then start to pull externally.\
So there\'s.\
A*Because I just wouldn\'t want this to end up in a situation where we\'re
afraid to talk about things. No, no, no, for sure. And so go back to
immersive learning.\
C*Now there are other firms that have a lot more capability than we do. So
I think we have enough thought now it\'s to be able to get a couple of
examples. So then we could do presentations. So another one I want to
talk about this one is.\
Who then is responsible for then taking the research and implementing it
into the beginnings of the projects? Because if that is a broken link,
this, this, I mean like, unless they\'re your application process,
right? Well, so this is like the immersive learning, right? Like we have
a huge chunk. I mean, I I.\
120 slides on this. Yeah. And an example of this was like Allie. So this
morning she asked for, I think it\'s like Taylor. We\'re doing an
interview and she said, oh, I\'d like the slides for immersive learning.
Yeah, I asked her to get with you. Yeah. So to take it into this now,
but that relies.\
On either you saying to the the principal or project manager who\'s
talking to the client like these are the things you need to bring up,
but if that if we\'re relying on that link is the only one only instance
that this can be in the external side.\
When you say external, is that are you talking about client? Well, yeah,
to get it. I mean, in order for it to get on a project, you have to talk
about it. Or like mass timber, right? Like if we\'re gonna do a new mass
timber school that has to be started from day one. And if that
conversation doesn\'t exist, I can do all all of the research in the
world.\
But if there\'s no method to put it into the beginning of a contract,
right? Yeah. So I think, I think what will help is the application. So
the project manager should be a part of that team.\
To ensure that that\'s going to happen or not, right? So they are the
keeper with the team on the budget. To your point on, we\'re not going
to have overtime. Just to be honest, we can\'t. Now it\'s going to come
out of the project somehow, some way.\
And that might mean a little extra effort or not, but that\'s why we\'re
aligning passions with drive through a project. And so like thinking for
that is more or less like who who is who is integrating the research
then into the project.\
Whoever that team is.\
A*So that that really relies on the principle, whoever is talking with the
client at the very beginning the day one.\
So it because it can\'t be like Neilan going to Will and say, hey,
let\'s do immersive learning on this project. 
C*I think in your
application we\'re trying to run those traps, right? So if Neilan\'s got
an idea, he should go to his people leader that we like getting that all
baked in in the application process. So there\'s awareness, it\'s not
just people.\
Looking for stuff outside of their job to do, which will then anchor it
to the work, right? So if I have an idea around mass timber, if I\'m
William Webb as a senior PA and he\'s trying to look for opportunities.\
I think it would be inherent on his part to get with his managing
principle to say let\'s look for opportunities together because you\'re
client facing unless so. So I\'m I was hopeful that in the application
process that starts to get baked in and as a panel we should ask those
questions, 
A*right.\
Right. 
C*To say, OK, that\'s interesting, but that\'s either going to be
outside of the work or right. And have you talked? So just so you know,
labor planning is not on managing principles anymore. They are not the
keeper of the hours or the people or the time.\
So that should help in this effort a little bit, but I\'m hopeful that
whatever it is now we\'re going to have to make some decisions as it
relates to dollars and investment for the firm, but that should take all
within that application and panel process.
A* OK, so on those who?\
Who is? Who is the keeper of those? Then keeper of what? Project hours?
Project labor? The directors?\
C*So those are per, well, like per. Yeah, well, like per. So for this one,
like per project.\
So I guess an example of this one is.\
A*I mean, like historically the the project hours always take preference,
right? Like if you have to get something done, you\'re doing the
drawings 100%, right?\
A*Even though, like even last year, I had the message with Eric on Flower
Bluff.\
A*Dude, I broke it down. It\'s so he\'s put it on Vantage Point everything
and his response was can you try to reduce it by 33%?\
So it\'s like if that is not even hours on the project, who then I guess
like has my back saying like no, you\'re gonna be deferring this on your
project time, like your project\'s gonna have these hours to it\'s
C* so
all positions have a utilization rate and they\'re not all 100%.\
Yeah. 
A*So there\'s 85. 
C*Yeah. So if some positions, I mean, it\'s just a
flux, right? And and you\'re getting down with the science, exact
science of it, it\'s, it\'s.\
Let me tell you this. I\'ve been with a firm for 30 years and we had
this making like a well-oiled Corvette machine and we did not pay
overtime. Our utilization rates were higher and we still got a lot of
\*\*\*\* done. So I think it\'s a cultural shift that we need to get
ahead of to start to set an expectation.\
But it\'s also filtered through the application process. I don\'t think
it needs to be everybody\'s ideas all. I mean, I\'m I\'m hopeful we get
200, but I doubt it. And then it\'s a realignment of effort and so I
will have that message.\
C*You\'ve now been put in a position of having that message and the
directors, which is Ali, Josh, Tony Schmitz, Tony Plascencia and Chad
Martin, are going to help navigate that conversation too, as it relates
to people\'s hours, effort, all that stuff.\
C*Now the project team will obviously be a part of that, but if you got a
project team member that has put in the application these individuals.\
I mean, that\'s the hope, right, is that we we handle all that
discussion in the application process. So it\'s not a oh, I\'m
surprising Eric with an idea. Now Eric just got in the middle of a.\
Firefight because projects were already kicked off. I mean, I guess I
would ask you, how do you see this happening?\
A*To be honest, this is gonna be super difficult. 
C*So that\'s for you to
help manage too.
A* So so I I did the math on it and on. So this is I guess
then this one is just so you\'re aware of the numbers so.\
With how the overtime was working last year is the first four hours are
unpaid. Yeah, right. Then anything after that is paid. If you are
working on the clock, you\'re still getting paid, but if you\'re doing
the RMB.\
Given your billing to the vantage point project number for RMB, you\'re
not billing to the project, so you\'re losing revenue. Yeah. So the
revenue lost at 2000 hours is \$255,000. Yeah, on the clock overtime.\
Is overhead of 50,000. So that comes down to it\'s like the more
research you do, the more revenue you\'re going to lose for sure versus
if it\'s spending 1/5 the cost if it\'s on overtime,
C* yeah.\
A*we\'re cool with that.\
C*Yeah, because then it\'s like you\'re still gonna battle all of the
whole people want to work 40 hours a week. That\'s on them. It\'s not
gonna help us as a firm, to be honest. But I get that that\'s 9098% of
the firm.\
C*As of today, for the last five years, only five people have worked
overtime.\
So this overtime conversation, no one\'s working it. I mean, you and
Logan did for that one middling effort. The rest of us are in the
positions we\'re at. We\'re working 70 hours a week. I\'m not getting
paid for it, to be honest. I don\'t care. I\'m trying to drive a firm,
so it really will be passion-aligned.\
With a team that cares about getting stuff done. So for Katherine and
Braden, they\'re figuring it out, right? We\'re trying to onboard Eric,
right? That was again.\
He was already kind of halfway in, but I think through the application
process we can ask these questions. I think we\'ll have to fine tune the
effort. We\'ll see, but.\
I mean, we\'re just trying to put as much framework as we can for this,
but no, it\'s going to be through a project or whatever it comes in the
application process. So are we billing the research hours to the project
or are we continuing with the the managed point?\
I think the coding as we did it last was what I told Lisa we were gonna
do. We need to we need to follow up with her because that might have
been forgotten. So the the RMB vantage point project numbers, I think we
still keep those.\
2.\
C*And as it relates to needing to tie into a project, I know she\'s now
rolling out getting coding. Yes, because I I saw that e-mail come
through and it\'s like, where\'s now? Now where is this being
categorized as?\
A*And for for me in my position, I don\'t have any control of that. So
it\'s then that goes back with the whole conversation where it\'s like
I\'m 
C*so let\'s not talk about control. Let\'s get ahead of it with Lisa,
OK to understand, hey, we\'re not, we\'re not dislodging this effort.
We\'re going to keep rolling.\
With RMB and a lot of it should be through the the project work. We\'re
gonna align it as much and as best as possible through the project work.
And so let\'s just see how she wants to help identify it, right?\
So she\'s the control is in your hands. Let\'s get that wording out of
your head. You\'re helping lead this effort. And so it\'s for you to
come with solutions to say, Lisa, I still need this, right? Because I
think we still want to track the effort. Now how best we do that?
Here\'s how we framed it as of a week ago.\
And but let her know, yeah, we\'re gonna tie as much of it through the
work as we can.\
C*OK, so I\'ll need to coordinate with Lisa then to structure the I\'d do
it today, the all the project stuff.\
C*Because I I sat with her briefly while we were talking about other stuff
and I said, you know, we we\'re still cruising with R&B. Yeah, her
analogy is that.\
If it\'s through the project work.\
We\'re paying people salary regardless. And then for us, it\'s just
being able to track the effort. She didn\'t get a sense that she needed
to do anything different.
A* Well, I can\'t. I can\'t.\
Create project numbers, correct. 
C*So it\'ll be anchored to a project, but
then it\'ll be a subset. I think it\'s how we framed it, right? No,
these are these are entirely different project numbers.\
It\'s not a sub number of a project we put to to show the integration.
A*It\'s its own product number and one of the sub numbers is project
integration.\
And through the research you\'re researching on the project. So because
if it\'s on a sub number that\'s because if it\'s build because if every
piece of research has to be a sub number of a project, you can\'t do
something that isn\'t on a project.\
C*So it has this year. That\'s what we have to do based on everything
else, I guess. I guess ask her, let\'s see. And again, all this is going
to be flushed out through the application process because I don\'t know.
Yeah, because that way you don\'t have to wait for a project to exist in
order to submit an idea.\
Bye.\
But I would hope that the idea quickly gets to the project. Now the
difference is like for Monse\'s.\
Is that research or is that best practices right? Does that need to be?\
Is that really an RV effort or is that just how we should be doing our
best practice as it relates to materials?\
Unless there\'s something I\'m missing in her effort, but.\
Yeah, I think we just meet with her and go through it. OK. And and
again, it\'s hard to answer without knowing what the what the ideas are
gonna be.\
You know, it\'s just if if they\'re not their own isolated things,
you\'re gonna just, you\'ll greatly reduce the number of opportunities
that you can explore.\
Because it\'s like, I mean like like mass timber looking at starting
mass timber. There wasn\'t a project for it and if you had had to have
to like pull strings to search for something to quickly align it to it.
So that\'s a perfect example of best practice as a firm that does
architecture. I would say that\'s not so much RMB, it is.\
As you framed it, but.\
I I gave that to you as it relates to we need to be.\
We need to be on level with our competition, so that\'s kind of a bridge
of R&B, but not so much.\
Um.\
The external side is the market differentiation, correct. And then your
internal is just your internal thought leadership. Yeah. So it\'s like
you can push that.\
But if you have to push it in lining with a project, a work that\'s been
secured, then you\'re it\'s like creates a situation where it\'s like I
really want to explore this, but I can\'t because we\'re not already
looking at it. It\'s like a chicken before the egg type of deal. Yeah,
some of this is R&B and some of it it\'s not.\
I mean, I would think like just opening it up to where it is part of it
and then you see where that idea goes. And I was like the whole like
with the pitch thing to make sure you\'re not like just, you know,
looking at Ant farms, you know, But if you\'re looking at Ant farms,
it\'s a new sustainable brick material that you can use on a facade and
it\'s fireproof.\



STOP HERE



Then it\'s like, OK, well then that\'s that\'s aligned to it. But then
if you have to say like, oh, we need an elementary school to use this
on, how did we define on your repo?\
What validates an RMB effort? Then we we went through that kind of.\
Rough concept of an idea to help frame people\' efforts.\
So if it fell into the different categories and the different scopes,
the different three levels, right? As far as like what the content or
what you\'re centering on, instead of coming up with predefined ideas,
you leave it completely wide open.\
And that way you get ideas that are like inside of the architecture box
or outside of it. And the outside ones is the market differentiation
where the inside the box ones is like stuff you\'re already doing and
it\'s like why are we looking at wall paints, you know, so it\'s.\
Leaving it open and not defining it allows the person to bring their
creative creativity into it, which gives them motivation to look at it.
So it\'s that was the whole intent of that. And then through the pitch
process you define like which is this something worth looking at? Like
if someone\'s like back to like an Ant farm, right?\
Or like fungus, right? Like, I really want to look at mushrooms and
you\'re like, why are you doing that? But then it\'s like the whole
pitch process is to then help them steer the idea towards something. No,
for sure. So it\'s like, oh, I want to look at, you know, like the
fungus brick blocks for facades.\
And you\'re like, OK, that\'s cool. But see that to me, you can, you can
talk about externally even though it\'s not on a project. Yeah, yeah, I
mean, that\'s the gauge is like we\'re talking conceptuals. I mean,
it\'s really hard to, I mean, once we get in the applications to know
where all this goes, I would say as quickly as we can like mass.\
Timber, when I had you do that, we quickly tried to get it enacted into
into the projects. So let\'s do this in your in your hours. We we burned
765 hours compared to what was planned was 2000.\
So would we roughly say going into this year we want to bucket 1000
hours worth of effort towards R&B?\
Now we\'re hoping to have a lot of those hours overlap in the project
work, right? Just like the Safara effort with Augustine that correlated
quickly to a to his work on the project as a senior PA. We\'ll try to,
as a panel, help navigate that conversation.\
And then it\'s an investment discussion being on if it\'s an idea that
is different, that might not necessarily have a project, as you\'re
saying, identified yet, but it\'s a great idea. I hadn\'t thought about
that. How does that differentiate Pfluger in the course of learning?\
Now everybody\'s starting to catch up to that. But anyway, does that
help? So for the 726 verse 2000, so mine was a.\
A chunk of that was for the dashboard and this cost estimating tool,
which is that your that was your effort. Yeah, so but so take that out,
OK, but I I don\'t have those.\
Actually, so take like like Monse\'s and Augustini. So I would say what
would be dangerous about that was there was no open pitch process
exactly and the fact that two of them technically got.\
Burned. Which ones? So it was the whole, all of the flower bluff. That
one pretty much got shot in half. And then and some of that we\'re going
to have all the mess, but I hope again through this application process
that you\'ve had a discussion as a project team.\
If it\'s related to a project, right. And a lot of those we\'ve kind of
taken out. So anyway, yes, Scott Burn, we\'re trying to build a process
moving forward that will help that. So if we if we decrease from 2000 to
1000 though.\
I\'m just throwing a number out. I would stay if the conversation\'s
already at 2000, I\'m framing all this around 2000, I would just say
stay at 2000.\
Is 2 so 2000 turns out to 10 RMB projects at 200 hours each.\
And that\'s gracious enough for all the other ones. So like, I think
Augustine\'s was like 170.\
140, yeah, we can, we can. That\'s so 2000, that\'s just a big bucket.
And then I guess we\'ll just go through the application process that and
that aligns to these sewers comes up, right. Mm-hmm. Or the benefit or
if it if it\'s even a RMB effort.\
Right. Some of these aren\'t. Some of them are like so far. I\'m like,
yeah, that\'s not really an RB effort, but based on where we\'re at as a
firm, every firm\'s doing that.\
OK, let\'s let\'s get with Lisa.\
And let\'s walk through what we did for R&B last year.\
Let\'s pick up.\
Our conversation that we that I had with her briefly about trying to
pull it into the into the work. So some of those hours we\'re hoping as
we steer this should be through the project work, but some of it\'s not.
Anyway, let\'s just have a bucket.\
Mm-hmm. So let\'s just get with her. Yeah. So yeah, starting it.\
Because it will help showing the the the scope breakdowns where it\'s
like 60 to 8080 to 120, 120 to 200. I think we\'ll have dollars in
there. My hope is that I don\'t think it\'s a budget. I don\'t. I think
we just need to know we\'ve got.\
Framework of time for people to be able to instigate it through
projects. I\'d just like to get her sense on it, OK?\
But I don\'t think as it relates to our 26 budget, we should show
\$60,000 whatever as a as an RB lot. I don\'t know, I just think we.\
Anyway, I\'ll get her sense on that. Set up a time with her. Yep.\
We\'re gonna do that ASAP too today or tomorrow, so get Craig going.\
Yep, get Lisa going, get Lisa going and we\'re launching end of January.
So then another budget question is then for R&B expense.\
So for last year we didn\'t have an expense. An example of this one is
so Katherine, she wants to branch out hers to do post document studies
on the Denton projects. Yeah, and that\'s actually something I have.\
I gave to Brenda to Lee before Katherine was even here, so maybe
they\'re they\'re collaborating on it, I think. I don\'t think that\'s
an R&B effort.\
We\'ve talked about post occupancy surveys for five years. So if it\'s
not, then what what project does that go to? Cause for me that\'s that
that is a complete continuation of their phase one. Yeah, so Part 2 for
them.\
And to be able to study that without having to be like restricted to
what the project is, have an outcome, being able to fail on it. Yeah. So
I\'ve actually put that in Brenda\'s goals, OK. So we can work that
through Brenda\'s salary. So she\'s, she\'s anchored a little bit the
projects.\
But she\'s she\'s a broader. She\'s like you, right? She helps a firm.
And so maybe we work that through Brenda, through Katherine. It\'s a
best practices. I don\'t think that\'s an R&B effort.\
So they put that time to. That\'s a coding thing with Lisa. OK, as you
can tell, I\'m not so concerned, but I know people are. But I\'m like,
if we\'re to be competitive with other firms, these are just things we
need to be doing.\
Yeah.\
And you don\'t want to use the R&B platform to not do host occupancy. I
think it\'s a good effort that Catherine is doing. So that\'s not an R&B
effort in my mind. So, so to take that to like an R&B scope, like how I
would see it would be if you could put like heart monitors on all the
kids.\
And then you have them like different or you were able to like, you
know, observe like where they go, where they congregate and everything
because like that is a significant effort to do. And it\'s like you
can\'t just, I mean you can, but then you don\'t, you\'re not able to
like evaluate it, run analysis on it.\
Do heat maps of the floor plans. You\'re showing this school is rotated
this way. This one\'s getting sunlight here. Is there a correlation
between student activity and focusing it as like a research example? I
know at Corian that they did that for all of health science.\
Hospitals did that in my past life. And so it\'s like those they they
frame that as research. Yeah, I know. And it\'s like that would be an
awesome publication to have, you know, or even just awareness
internally, you know, because let\'s you jump on here and you go, oh,
let\'s.\
What are, what are the limitations of having my playground laid out like
this? Yeah, it\'s like, oh, well, we have concrete examples of three
schools that are facing different directions. It\'s that\'s.\
Yes, it is research, but it\'s also best practices.\
Well, I guess back to the question about the budget, if there\'s
expenses related to their R&B effort, how does we\'ll have to monitor
that. So that\'s why the bucket, yeah.\
Yeah, again, I did this for 30 years without having to. It\'s just not
the culture here.\
Check that I have to worry about dollars. It was more about the outcome,
right? So.\
Will need to be the gauge of the outcome so it doesn\'t stay in the
clouds.\
Doing your work.\
But it\'ll be an after. But then it\'s quickly, OK, we\'re going to do
this for multiple projects moving forward like Safara, right? Is that
dead on the vine now or are we actually doing that, you know, so the
question for.\
Augustine and Leah are are we actually doing this on Flower Bluff? I
mean, there are some low hanging fruit that we shouldn\'t have to seek
approval of for Eric. I mean, it\'s a software we have or we\'re not
having anymore, whichever one.\
So I think there\'s are, there are certain things we should just keep
pushing, right. So that\'s so that\'s the the muscles we\'re trying to
build. But yeah, let\'s just create a bucket, let\'s get with Lisa.
Obviously we\'re trying to push as much as we can in the project that
there are going to be some depending.\
My Doc and see, I think is a good one. That\'s gonna take some extra
effort. Mm-hmm.\
Let\'s get with her today, OK?\
We\'ll have to.\
I think I worked those 2000 hours with Terry last year, yes.\
That one was based off of all the historical R&B that was done. Yeah,
let\'s just carry that over with we had 2000 hours last year. We only
used not quite half.\
We can carry those hours that we had planned for last year to anyway.
OK, we can do that. All right. I\'m just, I\'m talking to Christian
Owens has stated in his record. I\'m capturing what we budgeted last
year. We did not call use budget to increase by 150%. I\'m borrowing
from from last year.\
I\'ll mention that Terry today. Um.\
What did that equate to? 2000 hours? It was \$50,000. It was it was 100
because it was \$50.00 an hour per person, so it was 100,000.\
Yeah, with so 100,000.\
With the effort of trying to have some overlap in the works, that\'ll I
mean that should help. Some of that, not all of it. Anyway, OK, let\'s
start there. OK, now we code it.\
Let\'s just regroup with Lisa, see what she says.\
Lot to get going. Yeah, we got to blow. We\'re blowing and going. Yep.
OK, good. And then just to just to confirm on this internal side of of
the chain of command. So just.\
So I\'m aware. Am I helping to lead it? You\'re leading it. Am I leading
it? You are leading it. Am I also directing it? Yes. OK, so that\'s a
part of your.\
Announcement. OK, so for that then, who do I need to talk to to get
people\'s hours approved within not hours approved, hours diverted? Why
don\'t we?\
Is that the people leader or is like, how is, how is it going up and
then down? You know, because someone\'s gonna submit a form, right?
We\'re gonna talk about it, but we have to make sure that it\'s aligned
to whatever I think it\'s for us to.\
Um.\
Depending on what the idea is and if it\'s anchored to a project that
that might be a series or a question in that series of questions we\'re
asking is.\
Have you gotten with your people leader on this, right? Because they
need to be aware of what their people are doing anyway. But then we can
specifically ask if there\'s not somebody already a PM on that. They
should be. They should be a part of your effort to help navigate the
conversation.\
My thought is that we do that in the application process and then what
you and I can do is to get with the directors next week as it relates to
OK, we\'re we\'re gonna push this out at the end of.\
January Just know we\'re going to need your help as it relates to
staffing and some people are might be totally interested in trying to do
this through their work, so just be conscious of that when we\'re
talking to each office.\
So I think it\'ll be a lot of us with you leading that to make sure
it\'s happening. So in that conversation of the application process, we
will get that all out.\
So Katherine, you want to do occupancy evaluation with Brenda. Great
idea. Now that\'s on an existing project. You\'re going to have some
client interface.\
Have you talked with the project manager over at Denton? Because you\'re
going to need that person to help have those conversations, right? We
don\'t need Katherine going out there and oh, I\'m going to do a study.
No, you need to go through the chain of their chain of command as it
relates to that client, right? So that\'s Tony Schmitz, who, oh, is a
director.\
Those type conversations so we can help navigate that in that
application process. That\'s one look at the idea.\
Get inside it sucks.\
It\'s about bongus.\
Not sure how that\'s gonna help us anyway, you know what I\'m saying? So
I think for us as a panel, the question for you is did we set it up to
where we\'re getting these applications all throughout the year or are
we honing in on March 1st, bring your ideas and we are as a panel gonna
look at all these ideas and then as a.\
Select.\
The ones that make sense for this year based on the effort and time.\
What do you think?\
So I would ask then is who is we as a firm? What do you mean? Like who?
Who would be deciding that? That would be you and I. And let\'s start
there and Brenda and Josh as it relates to the ideas.\
As it relates to the work, who else?\
Keep the panel as small as possible. That\'s why I think those four OK.\
And then in my.\
I can then take those to the exact team. We meet weekly. So depending on
when we get these in, I think that\'s the next step is why don\'t we
through your process, let\'s let\'s do a presentation of the exact
team.\
Cool before we roll it out.\
Yeah, that\'s that\'s pretty fast. It\'s pretty fast. Yeah, then because
I would, I wouldn\'t want Ben for that to be.\
You just have so many more hands in the cookie jar, which I completely
get. I understand. Yeah, that would just be presentation. We wouldn\'t
ask input.\
I really like the font to be on the left side. OK, so the the other
style for this is to with integrating AI into it, it can kind of almost
function as its own self-running entity.\
Where instead of interfacing with the person with themselves or us to
help develop their pitch, they interface with the AI which knows the
pitch process. Perfect. And so they are integrating with it and then
once they\'re complete.\
They hit complete and it checks it and then it goes, there we go. And
then it goes to a bigger list. You\'re the spearhead. OK, you\'re the
leader. OK. Welcome to leadership. Been there, done that.\
Yeah, I think the biggest thing, as you said, is just getting with Lisa
how we continue to code it or not keep track of the of the efforts.\
I think she just when I talked to her briefly was just to keep it as a
part of the project work and that\'s when we have the subsets. But I
think keeping a bank of of time and all that. So let\'s get that answer
or validate.\
Evaluate the hours. Get with Craig if in Austin. If you have not, let\'s
get those softwares loaded.\
Touch base with Lauren.\
Because I told her there are certain things you need because we\'re
running and she knows that. So touch base with her saying based on
yesterday\'s conversation, I really need these loaded today. Now it\'s
the low hanging dollars.\
Just so she can help communicate with Crag if Crag is.\
Whatever he\'s doing, right? So at least we\'ve touched everybody. It\'s
not gonna be an issue. I think just if if if it helps her push Crag to
get this loaded, that\'ll help. That\'ll help you get this going.\
And who was I talking to, Chad? Oh, so.\
Chad as it relates to Fine Arts had.\
Some things as it relates to budget, but they they go to conferences and
such.\
That would be the expense piece.\
Which I mean, we can have that budget. I\'d rather take that or.\
Or the OR the the 2000 times the 1.5 exactly. I think we\'re going to be
limited to our conference attendance this at least for this year. So for
those I I I wasn\'t foreseeing like conferences as being like expensive.
It would be like trips to go.\
See something or go like go with the team to see it. Like if you had, I
don\'t just like, I mean it\'s, yeah, like if you\'re going to go to
like Corpus Christi to see the immersive learning environment and
you\'re gonna do a hands on one-on-one with your students, yeah.\
I think it\'s just the way it\'s been framed in the past was was weird.
So you had Fine Arts, you had psychology and all that. So Fine Arts.\
Would go.\
I thought they had their own budgets.\
Um.\
Well, do they?\
They did.\
Think so, yeah, for cause I know Shelby was tracking all their like
finances for the immersive learning one and then like the no cause it
was like the Autodesk convention. Yes, it was outside of the R&B.\
It wouldn\'t. It was in our conference and professional development
call, not R&B, but these groups tapped into that. But I think this year
I don\'t think we\'re gonna be able to do that. So if if the.\
R&B project hours bucket is 2000 hours. You could just roughly call it
100,000. Yeah, and that covers time and expense materials. You have to
buy a center or something. Sorry.\
You guys, y\'all aren\'t going to Vegas to learn more about well that
software so that way it\'s it\'s it\'s tied to your because all of those
it\'s because one of the questions on the pitch form is like what are
the additional resources that you need. So you know going into it like
what the person is wanting to do or if if it\'s like I want to.\
To buy like 1000 lbs of mushrooms. Well, we\'re not doing that. And
they\'re like, well, you need to go see the farm because I know, I know,
I know Chad\'s asking about what the R&B effort is because I think they
were budget because I think they were.\
They had conferences earmarked for the Fine Arts R&B group to go attend
this conference every year, which that\'s not what we\'re talking about.
Yeah, it would be so much. What is their pitch that they have? Yes. And
does that conference really?\
Relate to it. Yeah. And what do you what did you gain thus far by
attending them every year for the last two years? That\'s always my
question. Well, nothing. OK, well, we\'re not doing that anymore. I met
up with the Superintendent. I had to create beers with him.\
I think everything I\'ve heard, it\'s it\'s it\'s been.\
A BD thing, but I\'m like, well, what? OK, if you\'re met, if you\'ve
met fine art directors at these school districts, how has that helped us
get into that school district? And right now it\'s big fat zero. I\'m
just helping in the conversation because I know some of those questions
will come up. Chad\'s already asked me, what\'s our R&D effort for Fine
Arts?\
Or budget. Well, you\'re not going to get one. You\'re going to have it
through an application process. I think he\'s asking in terms of signing
up for conferences.\
And I had not thought about that.\
Other than that\'s not in the R&B effort. Well, it\'s it\'s tied to
which we\'re gonna be limited to. So I guess with the remaining time
that I wanted to go this this repo thing. So this is ultimately the
whole like layout of it and whatnot.\
Once you have a picture of Mass Timber, it\'s it\'s coming. We we got we
got the projects in here. This is your template. It\'s it\'s more than
that. So I mean we got all sorts of stuff. So this would be the external
side. Yeah. So the external side you have your big splash projects and
everything.\
You have your canvas which is then this one. I may scrap this one. This
one was meant to be more of like an interactive map thing where you can
then see like different demographics or if part of your research thing
is like looking at like wages or something, then you can see it visually
be able to explore all the different projects, different offices.\
And what not the explore is would be all the work. So we come to the
explore tab and these are all organized by project number. So these were
all from last year that we did and then.\
2004.\
And the process is then at the end of someone\'s research, they create
one of these and then this is kind of like then how that\'s displayed
with the public side, the ones that we want to display out. This is then
what the person would see. So you can see all the different different
pieces of it in like project photos.\
This kinda one just goes through it. So when you say public sign this
would be if if we want something to be on this piece. So there\'s a
there\'s a paywall right? And for this one would be then like if if and
if we don\'t have any projects then nothing appears right?\
But are you thinking this is, um, if I\'m a client, I can go to this?
Yes. Oh.\
Yeah. And then connect tab so they can come in contact with us if you
want to see something that you\'re interested in. And this way it\'s not
just us figuring out ideas. This could be some teacher submits an idea
and then we can see like, oh, that\'s interesting. How does that relate
to it? Oh, wow, you\'re in this.\
This district, maybe we could team you up and stuff like that.\
I think that\'s a cool idea. So coming to works and this just links to
our. Yeah, so that\'s what I was wondering. So that is linked like
Gensler\'s, right? Yeah, this would be a separate, this would be a
subdomain. So on our website you got this.\
I need to challenge you on the name. I\'m stuck on it. Keeping it. The
repo feels like I\'m gonna take your car away, though. Yeah, take away
your ideas. But yeah, and then about so research and benchmarking
process.\
Process tools we use for use of like AI and then kind of how we source
insight stuff. So you\'re a wizard. Thank you. So if you log in here
then it comes into the internal side. So with this one is is all of the
research can be.\
It takes it in a way where an AI can read it. So the idea for the
internal side is you just interface with it. So if you have a project
about something and it can then help steer you to an answer, there\'s a
big lack of this one is like kind of what I was talking about with like
you have your project manager or someone.\
Like, you know, someone goes talks to a school district, they have no
idea about all the projects, but this could help them prep for it. Yeah,
yeah, I know that\'s that\'s awesome. So then you have a research
schedule to be able to see like where everything is, how it\'s aligning
with everything.\
Contacts. So then this is also integrated in with the whole database to
where you can see all the different people who are working with it.
These are also other like researchers and people that we got from the
other convention. So you can see like cross their pieces one other
convention.\
This is for TASM Midwinter. Oh yeah, so I pulled in like it\'s a it\'s a
big database of all these people. So you got Rice University, Texas
Architect can reach out to them even better. So in the pitch process
then.\
You build it with your A I. So when you would sign in, it would pull
your schedule from vantage point. So you can see like with the stuff
you\'re worked on, what you have slated, your weekly capacity and then
you start building your pitch with the A I. So it runs through all the
different steps and make sure you have everything. So this way.\
Someone doesn\'t because with the old process you could skip stuff and
it would rely on the person knowing what to fill in. Yeah, so this way
when everything gets filled out then it comes into the my pitches which
are kind of these guys which then.\
You, Brenda, Josh or I can then see them and comment on them and so you
could comment on it. Great question. We love the focus or this will
revise and resubmit and then they can come back and reiterate with the A
I to help finish it up and then once it\'s green lit then they can start
working on it. Sweet.\
I love it. And there\'s pretty much just in these two tabs and then you
just work through it and then the A I is then able to build, build out
all of these pages. Yeah, that\'s awesome. So this is like the
Timberline study.\
So then I can take all of your data that is researched with you. Yeah,
and then put it into this. Can you? Can you put?\
Bubbles of photos of team members. Yes, it\'s so like for your mass
timber, right? It would. Yeah, that\'s outside of just words. Yeah, but
I think having. Yeah, so that\'s the that\'s the vantage point
integration. So it\'s getting the schedule and then the person.\
OK, so then you have the contacts, like who do you need to talk to? So
like in your pitch process, you know, it\'s like, I don\'t have any
hours. You can see like who they\'re reporting to and everything. Oh,
that\'s cool.\
I love it. So you could just like dance around it and everything. And
then this this is all hidden behind like your login essentially your
login. So this has to be with then our our Azure single sign on.
Gotcha.\
So, so you\'ve got a tab on our web or we\'ll have a tab on our website
that says the repo, is that right? So I don\'t like if it\'s a sister,
yeah, I don\'t. Yeah, we could. It could be somewhere else.\
I don\'t. I don\'t make the website. I don\'t know who makes the
website. That\'s well, it\'s been made. We\'re gonna, we\'re gonna redo
it hopefully sooner than later.\
I think Shayla is the keeper of it, nuances, updating of photos and
such. So she has the capability of adding a tab that will then take you
to here. So I guess that\'s a question. Is it better to have that for
our staff to go to our website and then go to this or is it a intranet?\
Or this is the Internet. So I would what would you think best use? I
would not put it on SharePoint. Yeah, that is a whole that\'s like using
a program to make your program. Yeah, and then you\'re conforming to how
it works.\
And it\'s.\
It would then require the person to manually make the page. Yeah, and
nobody\'s got time for that, yeah. So keeping it off of this then allows
us to integrate AI into it all the different APIs, keep it as its own
separate standalone thing.\
And the other big important part is that somebody can look at it. We
need to talk about that.\
Um.\
C*I think as we roll this out, I probably wouldn\'t roll it out to the
public. Yeah, not until you have stuff to show, 100%. But you might.
Yeah, I mean, Billy Bob sitting at his house can send you all sorts of
stuff, right?\
A*Oh, they wouldn\'t. They wouldn\'t be able to do pitches. They just how
do you, how do you monitor or be the gatekeeper of that through your
sign on? So when you sign on, so like right here you only see like
Campus Explorer connected about, but when you sign in.\
A*If you\'re it when it\'s like integrated into like, you know, like if I
go to Outlook.com, it just opens up. Yep. So that\'s like kind of the
same mechanism of it. Gotcha. Gotcha. OK. But like if somebody randomly
goes on to flueger.com, you know, and goes to the repo or like, oh,
research.\
Have a sign in. Oh, it would just it would just go to this page. So it
just it just normally comes to a locked out piece.\
And then like if they see like, you know, sign in and it comes in like
gives me a password, but they would be able to get to the pitch or just
the splash page. It\'s just the splash page. OK, gotcha. So we can we
can manipulate what that splash page is. Yeah, that\'s have a login step
to that. That\'s all. 
C*Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.\
A*The the pitch process is just only for us.
C* Gotcha. 
A*They can contact and
send an e-mail. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I gotcha. The pitch process
and the repo is all our our internal, our internal stuff. Yeah.\
Well, and that splash page can could you could put active stuff as it
relates to publications and such, right? Yeah. So it\'s it. You would
see like your your campus be able to go to Explorer and then we can
shut, we can say like which ones we want to appear and which ones we
don\'t. Yeah, because I like Gensler\'s.\
You\'ve seen insulors, right? It\'s a separate research website, but you
can get to it through their active website. But once you go to the
research, it\'s not getting into the nuances of their pulling back the
curtain. It\'s just the publications.\
It\'s the outcome. It\'s not the in the middle of the activity. I\'m
just thinking of like down the road, once we actually get a lot of
content, it\'s sharing of our publications, right, to help speak to
expert. Anyway, I love it.\
OK, just make sure Billy Bob from Thornton could get in there and start
putting obscene pitches. We\'ll find out, yeah.\
OK, um, so we\'ll need to have this activated for your for your launch,
so that\'s something.\




Um, the repo being on our web.\
So for right now, you\'re just leaving this as a standalone for right
now. Yeah, it doesn\'t have to be linked. It\'s it\'s its own domain. So
how I\'ve been doing all the other ones is it\'s just like the
name.flugarchitects.com. So it\'s like vision is
vision.flugarchitects.com. This one is just like the
repo.flugarchitects.\
What is the repo meaning to my repository?\
OK, it\'ll stick. Don\'t worry, it\'ll stick. I\'ll let it simmer. I\'ll
let it simmer. The repo man is gonna take your car away. Yeah, take it
all. So for for the internal side is pretty much like until there\'s
like, you know, content to put on it.\
You could just keep these and it\'s just like connect, you know, OK. Or
we could have just like a a splash page or something. Or maybe there\'s
not even an an external facing piece and it\'s all just behind. I think
for future it would be nice. That\'s why I say pull up genslers.\
I\'m just trying to get an I so it it says the premise of the research.\
Look at that as kind of a model because I think at some point, not day
one, but maybe near future, right? So that.\
It\'s ours all. That\'s how they formed their firm interiors. It\'s all
about the office.\
I mean, at some point it\'d be great to get to this point, but they\'re
they\'re given the overarching.\
Purpose around research. Now they have a lot of content.\
Go back. Is this their? Now this is is this their?\
There.\
New trends.\
So I think this one goes to like where where the line is between like
what is research and what isn\'t. Mm-hmm. Because it\'s like this, this
is, this is research stuff. Well, this is that under there for. I don\'t
have touch screen.\
That\'s all I have. I use it too much. That\'s what I was doing on
Ariana\'s. So they used to. So they they have folded. They used to have
another.\
Website. Well, let me see there.\
Yeah, so they\'ve just folded it in recently and did just their regular
web.\
Did you already hit that? Hit that. Learn more.\
Yeah, so this is kind of their splash page. I don\'t think there\'s.\
So see.\
55 funded, right? Um.\
I don\'t.\
We\'re not here yet, but as you think about a splash page, it can it can
be built to start to be additive, but at least it shows you the topics
and I think if you were to go on those, it just shows publications, but
it doesn\'t show you.\
The soup just yet. But anyway, I think anchoring it to our side\'s
awesome. Yep. Gotta keep it on there. Good. Yes. All right. So I guess
we\'ll circle back. Go ahead and get with Lisa. Go ahead and get with
Craig.\
And then you\'re going to talk to Terry about the hours, say we\'re
going to use what we did last year. OK, see what he says. OK, yeah.\
So last time I when I get back with you after that, when I went to
e-mail Lauren about the hours and processes, everything like mid June,
mid-december, I kind of like opened up a can of worms and I kind of felt
there was like other processes that I wasn\'t aware of that were going
on.\
Uh, see. Similarly, it was like the budget, the process of how that\'s
getting approved. Yeah, and.\
Now moving forward with these, just you know, learning from that, are
there any other things that I should be aware of or things to not step
on? Historically we have set the budget in December.\
Because of this year, we always solidified either at end of year or in
January. So for this year it is in January.\
So it\'s just several conversations in order to get to the final budget,
but now, OK.\
I mean for one getting the the reason it\'s also delayed is because we
hired Lisa in the middle of all this and then we are doing 0 based
budgeting to where we\'re not just taking what we did last year and just
pulling it in starting fresh. Every firm should do 0 based budgeting
right based on what the.\
Efforts are what we want to focus on. So that\'s why it\'s shifting to
this spot too. And typically for our firm, we\'re closing the books for
last year in January. So that kind of help bring some clarity around it.
It\'ll be a lot better this year.\
Well, because of Lisa and everything else has been new, new people, new
processes. OK, yeah, I just don\'t want to be in like a a spot. Put
myself in a spot where it looks like I\'m trying to jump the gun.\
Yeah, it\'s not jumping the gun, OK?\
No, um, and actually, I mean, it should help in for long budget, right?
So don\'t feel like you. I feel like I\'m like I\'m super on top of it.
So no, just everybody else is not. So I\'m saying that because Lisa\'s
not been here that long and she\'s got a lot on her plate, so.\
Just know that\'s why we\'re not where we need to be. But because she\'s
got a lot, she\'s she worked over the holidays, right? So she\'s trying
to get caught up to help solidify a budget for this year. So it\'s been
a little clunky, but we\'re smoothing it out, OK? Yeah, I just. I don\'t
want to be that guy.\
No, you\'re not. Oh, I need to get all my stuff approved. And then it\'s
well, we have all the I told her and to say, hey, there\'s things we got
to we\'re running. So we either got to get going on, get Craig on it. So
that\'s a part of that conversation today. The piece we got to tie a bow
on is.\
Lisa\'s coding in part just so we can bring more clarity to her. How
it\'s structured in vantage point. Yeah, and get her input. Mm-hmm. This
is.\
Anyway, just just trying to put a dot on it. OK, get with her ASAP. Oh,
first get your software.\
Yes. So I I did. I did send my e-mail out yesterday for end of this
week. So I guess has you have you got a response from the crowd? I was,
I was just gonna check. Yeah, I don\'t think that\'s any that shouldn\'t
be any problem.\
Nothing yet. No, just the thing. Thanks. Um.\
I can still like, so I guess the the the big hiccups for me right now is
I I don\'t have the AI models to work with \'cause I need that API key
which requires a a credit card and like put 5 bucks on it.\
So that\'s the hiccup for this one. The other one is like all these
databases. So it\'s like I have to store all this information somewhere
and right now I\'m doing it on Bluehost, which is kind of like our
website thing, yeah.\
I was hoping that we could move it off of that. It just makes it a lot
more streamlined to like, just manipulate all the data and everything.
Yeah, I can still keep working on Bluehost, but the main thing I just
want to make sure is like they\'re they\'re trying to like change around
like username and passwords and like who has access to what.\
And I just, I don\'t want to be modifying stuff on our website cuz it\'s
pretty janky. It\'s like if you click the wrong button, like I could
take.com. So yeah, coordinate that with Craig and just to see if we can
get the account username set up. Yeah, and like what he\'s trying to do.
Yeah, cuz I can\'t really speak to that. I know y\'all were talking.\
About the hosting and who could possibly host, I think Craig, you and
Craig can help spearhead that. I mean, Lauren\'s not going to know.
It\'s really just about a \$0.00 implication to what we\'re talking
about. So if there\'s something better, have that conversation with
Craig too.\
Because it is something we\'re changing in two months. We don\'t want to
do that. Yeah, because it\'s like, I don\'t, I\'m not, I don\'t, I
don\'t know what the conversations they\'re having about it is. So it\'s
like, are we having like dedicated accounts for things? Are accounts
going away? Are we using this account? Well, you earned it for the first
time yesterday.\
That\'s why you were folded into that conversation yesterday. So you can
help. You can help navigate that.\
Of the different usernames, not usernames, but is it Bluehost or not? Or
software? Oh OK, yeah, I don\'t know. Is Bluehost a subscription that
we\'ve already paid for for the year? It\'s or is it a month, a month or
it\'s like in bulk? There\'s like 2.\
So we use Squarespace to like build the website and Bluehost is kind of
just like the truck we put the thing on the back of. Yeah. And then the
truck drives around. We we pay for the truck driving. It\'s just a
really clunky truck. So I think that\'s what it was like Craig\'s point
was like, you know, there\'s other trucks that you can put all your
stuff on.\
And shop around for those. Yeah. However, Heather was the one who was
controlling that, so I don\'t know who\'s plate that shifted to. That\'s
gonna be like the new marketing person. Like it all just stays working
how it is until they come on and then it shifts.\
But like I said, I can keep working on these. The the big one is just
this Claud API and then getting all the Claud stuff figured out because
that one\'s like, I mean, it\'s on Chris\'s Fluger e-mail account. So
it\'s like cleaning that. Those are like the big ticket items, yes.\
Yeah. So reminding to work backwards. Yeah. So it\'s like the the, the,
the two clawed ones are like the big hold up for this guy. And you sent
those specifics to Craig. Yeah, I listed every everything out. And then
I also listed, yeah, the which ones maybe.\
Which ones require a card and which ones don\'t? Maybe did you? Did you
tell him why the importance around why you need this stuff? Like we\'re
we\'re launching stuff here pretty soon or no?\
Um.\
You gave him until Friday, though.\
I was hoping that we would we we could we could change them by Friday.
OK. And he hadn\'t responded yet. Just follow up with him later today.
What is today? What\'s Dave?\
Yeah, yeah, no. So it\'s like the main ones holding production are the
Azure SSO, which is the the single sign on the Bluehost Cloudflare suit
base. This is the where the data is and then what the truck looks like
and then the Claude, yeah, so he\'s he\'s got that vantage point and
open asset are.\
We talked with Leslie, so we have that one that\'s that\'s figured out.
The other one\'s just the the vantage point and then the and and I did
say all the others work right now, so.\
Yeah.\
Um, Austin\'s here.\
And you can kinda.\
Get his ear to say, um, do you have Craig send an e-mail \'cause I know
they\'re probably talking hourly. That\'s that\'s the other one too.
It\'s like, I don\'t.\
How big of asks these are? And it\'s like if I\'m kinda asking Craig to
do stuff, I\'m kind of like saying I wanna buy your time. He\'s gotta do
it anyway. Yeah, the I mean the the other option would be I could do it,
so so maybe just ask him.\
Just give him a call. Hey, just wanted to follow up on that e-mail I
sent you. Not wanting to put a burden. Do you need my help? I mean,
you\'re asking, you know, I can. I can help for sure. Just don\'t want
to step on me by his toes, right? Yes. And you can.\
He can lean on you or Austin or whatever. Yeah, I think it\'s OK to call
him. Give him a shout. Hey, I sent you a long e-mail. Yeah, I don\'t
want to overburden you. Yeah, that\'s that\'s not right. Hey, how can I?
How can I help? Or is there anything you need from me?\
Right. Yeah. Because it\'s just like, I don\'t want this to just be a
friend. OK. But it\'s also in that time you\'re like, I got stuff to do.
Well, I mean, it\'s either that or like, we\'d all just like, you know,
I\'m, I\'m like out of, I can. I\'m just gonna call, OK.\
That\'s what I told Lauren in December. We got stuff to do, so I need
this approved now. OK, for the January then I need to set up a date for
that. So the other crux is that is after the Tasmaid winter.\
Yeah. So timing. So if that needs to be the first week of February when
people are back, I think find best impact of time when everybody\'s in
their office, OK. So don\'t do it during a conference or I think it\'s
important for everybody to see.\
And then we hype it up. Let\'s get Logan to do an animated pitch, OK,
through e-mail or whatever to say.\
8.\
Research coming your way 26, January 31st, whatever, right? All right.\
Yeah, look at, look at, look at the calendar at what best day that is. I
mean regardless if it\'s on a Friday at the end of January or the first
week of February, just that conference, do not do it that. Yeah, OK. Do
we, are we doing a like first quarter stay of the firm?\
I don\'t know yet.\
Typically, but that\'s the guts to be like March. I mean quarters was
maybe. OK, I think I was supposed to talk to Claire about setting those
dates up being firm event days for meeting. Yeah, we.\
Wait on that. You should just pick a day first and then figure out who
is that just for you to be able to share efforts. So it would be two
parts. It would be to to share the work that was done in previously.\
The new process and then the new tools.\
Oh, no. Well, you\'re doing that in January. Yeah, that would be kind of
the launch. Yeah. So that\'s a standalone. So you\'re wanting to have
touch points throughout the year. Oh, I I didn\'t think about that.\
Doing like a.\
Quarter in review. I mean, that\'s really up to you.\
Or that would share out. I think when we were talking with Heather and
Cody about that one, it was making sure we have enough content to talk
about and then that way you\'re not scheduling A5 minute meeting.
Exactly. And I think it would be better to like kind of gauge. That\'s
right, the influx, I think that\'s right.\
And then the process about people doing it, figuring, ironing that out
and then, yeah, seeing them on, let\'s.\
I I would agree with that. And then how can we get people excited about
it? Almost like what I was just really, I was kind of being quirky, but
I think it\'s real. It\'s like how can we market it to the firm that
there\'s a this is important, right. So maybe think through that we can
lean on Logan, like how do we?\
We\'re about to relaunch something and it\'s extremely important without
saying that, right? We want to get people jazzed up about what? What is
this about? Right. So maybe we just start with that. No, we will
schedule state of the firms. That was for Heather to help us.\
Just the design reviews. The design. Oh, your design check-ins check.
Yeah, \'cause I had just pinged Tony on that.\
Um, \'cause that was some thought to that, because now I\'m gonna let
him take that over with you and.\
Josh. Oh, so by the way, I need to tell you this thing. We\'re gonna do
a So every year I\'ve been here, I\'ve done a design call.\
You you have not physically been here while I\'ve had those.\
What\'s the design for? You might ask. I usually do those in January,
February with all designers and interior designers and planners, which
is Josh and Brenda.\
The purpose of that is 1 inspiring, but it\'s also to help create what
we want this firm to do through action. So you will be a part of that
form. But now I\'m giving the baton over to Tony to help lead that.\
When is that? I guess we don\'t. Yeah, yeah, OK. He\'s looking for dates
right now.\
But that\'s strictly with the designers, though. No, it\'s different
this year. It\'s gonna be directors, not everybody, because we can\'t
afford to have everybody, but it\'s gonna be directors.\
At least two to three people for office.\
And that is not dependent upon role. That\'s gonna be who.\
Who are the catalysts to instigate things and empower people?\
So.\
For instance.\
Corpus, it might be Eric and Marlon.\
So some of these things you were talking about earlier is like we\'re
going to invite some of those parties to the table to say when we talk
about our goal as a firm is to create.\
Inspiring environments and client experience.\
What is? What do you think that is?\
So that\'s going to set some action steps, but you\'ll be a part of
that. That agenda is getting developed.\
But look for that in February, probably. That\'s nothing for you to help
plan for, but you are going to be invited to that party. There\'s some
homework, so.\
Because that would be a good one to like kind of introduce the ideas of
like people on your projects are gonna be looking at this stuff. So you
could have a it\'s gonna the same message 10 times. OK, one, you\'re
launching it to the firm. Two, we\'ll have this forum quickly to say OK
now.\
Lead research. Now I\'m empowering you to ensure that it\'s happening in
your office. Mm-hmm.\
Believe me, I attack it like a warplan. Oh, I know, yeah, it\'s not
hitting it up front. We actually got suits on the side. And oh, by the
way, I got a coast coming back behind Cadillac. I hit. Wait, let me
eight eight different levels. And no, by the way, you didn\'t think
about the sky, OK?\
Or the summary it\'s gonna bother you. So there\'s some things.\
I don\'t think it\'s any extra work for you. I think it\'s just
basically, um, hey, you heard me launch.\
Getting input, but also empowering, right? I mean, that\'s the first
thing I did here as it relates to design thought is I pulled everybody
in and versus me telling you.\
What I think a design process is, I\'m like, we\'re going to create this
together. So that\'s what you will be doing as a leader, right? You\'re
pushing this out, but you\'re going to need, you\'re going to need an
army of instigators.\
So we\'ll be doing it through research. We\'ll be doing it through Ali
on interiors. So it\'s not just interior designers. I need, I need
project managers. I need PAS to understand the importance around
interiors, the importance around research, the importance around design
process, the importance around educational planning from Brenda.\
Brenda, so each one of you are going to speak to that, but it\'s
empowering to say now you\'re why are are there any hiccups to what you
heard? You want your input? OK, if not, now help push it, right? Make
sure it\'s happening. So that\'s an example of what I did for design,
right? Why is this important?\
Because one, every competitor that\'s in our warehouse is doing this. If
you\'re not doing it, you\'re going to die. Just to be very you\'re not
doing research, you\'re going to die. We\'re going to sit stacked.
Almost setting that tone at the very beginning. Why is research
important? It\'s not a nice to have.\
Know that Corgan\'s been doing it for 30 years now. DLR. So for you
saying it\'s not important, wrong, it is. Or else we won\'t have a firm
in 10 years.\
Right. Or if we are, we\'re just doing mechanical and reuse of IDIQ.
That\'s inspiring. So just give me a heads up. OK, so that\'s how I\'m
helping you and them in that form.\
OK, so it\'s not just looking at a bubble on the screen saying Alex is
now leading this. There\'s gonna be something.\
Major steps.\
OK. And I guess then in that form, identifying then like the the allies
in those fronts. So in that room, we will make sure the allies are
there. OK. I think for Eric, there\'s just a lot of awareness, right? He
doesn\'t know. He\'s on. I think he got put in a big pickle. He
didn\'t.\
And it\'s not from him. I know. So you got to put in a big pickle.
We\'re arming with Eric. We\'re arming with Mike Adami in Houston,
right? So we\'re we\'re gonna sprinkle some Nuggets, right? Because I
know everyone that I\'ve talked to on this stuff, they\'re.\
Extremely. They\'re excited about it, so they should be. That\'s why I
think we\'ll find a way, right, to get these things going. I just don\'t
want us to be restricted by.\
So I know it\'s the reality of our time, but like I I\'ve done this
without time or anything else with a firm of 30,000 people was not an
issue. And if those though you tell you those big firms do look at every
penny, we\'re 100 people.\
Sure, you rate. Yes. So I\'m trying to knock down those hurts. OK, but I
think having the bucket is helpful. Let\'s get with Lisa.\
Maybe visit with Austin first. He might know. He might not. He might
know. I I teamed him. Yeah, I did. OK. I teamed him and he well, it was
yesterday. I I caught him when he was going out the door. And yeah, he
said to just.\
Luke Craggin, so I can just re ping him. Does that help? Yeah, yes,
we\'ll meet again. Yeah, yeah. And then to just, especially before this
whole kickoff thing goes. And the other one too is to if there\'s.\
Any way to bring like sub internal awareness that this is going out
because the last thing would be it goes out and then APM it\'s like what
are you what are you doing you know and then it\'s like immediate
roadblock. So I don\'t know if if they this this the design forum.\
Would\'ve been an interesting one to have before, because then it\'s
kind of you\'re you\'re gonna telling everybody about it, but you\'re
not releasing it. You\'re gonna just give them like a little preview,
getting the feedback, making sure everyone\'s like, well, that\'s
that\'s somewhat aware.\
The the cruxes with the January coming up and then how I\'m kind of
already set back is creating all of it to like a working standpoint.
It\'s probably not doable in like the next week and a half, but the
framework and everything about like how we\'re approaching it.\
I think that can be talked about, so I don\'t know if that could be like
just an e-mail teams, a brief blip.\
Given that people, well, you mean to the whole firm? No, just to like
the select few kind of like where this like because that\'s how it kind
of geared this like the design, the forms kind of working where it\'s
like a select pool. Yeah, it\'s a select pool and these are like the
people that you\'re just like letting them know and like that way it can
already be. Yeah, the trailer, Yep.\
Brings like a little, so let\'s do that on the.\
We could do that with the directors, yes, now.\
I\'m going through the list of people with Tony. We haven\'t solidified
that yet.\
Because that\'s going to be related to the budget too. And I think the
week or the day and a half we were targeting was in San Antonio after
CASA midwinter because some of those PMS will be in San Antonio
already.\
So I\'m trying to minimize cost. Oh yeah, because everyone\'s going to
the convention. Well, at least the PMS are.\
At least the ones we were talking about inviting and you know you\'ve
got Tony and Lindsey and then the rest of us in Austin can just drive
down. We don\'t have to stay the night, right? So we are looking at a
day and a half of work workshop.\
Mhm.\
So at the very least, maybe just give Tony heads up. We\'ve talked, we
can.\
Post to the directors to give them a heads up to you on the R&B effort.\
Well, if I could tell him first.\
Will enough because I might have you. Will enough of the people who need
to know be at TAS Midwinter?\
Because then we kind of just just do it there.\
Yeah, \'cause you\'re gonna be there now you\'re there.\
But I\'ll also be in San Antonio. Yeah, I think we\'re that conference
ends on Tuesday or Wednesday.\
We were looking at Wednesday or Thursday, like the two days after that
overlap.\
Oh.\
I can. I can just. I\'ll put him on my To Do List here just to touch
base.\
Yeah, because the directors are overloaded with labor plans right now.\
But at least at least you can start coordinating with Tony on the
agenda. Mm-hmm. At least let him know that you and I talked.\
And it doesn\'t. If it\'s if it\'s an agenda item, it does. It honestly
doesn\'t have to be a 20 minute thing. You know, I think it\'s just
whatever you need time. You just need to let them let them be aware of
it before it happens. I think it\'s the best thing.\
And that this thing is coming, your people are gonna be excited about
it. Here\'s the best ways to support them. Yeah, because I know I need
you coupled with Chad as it relates to a potential BIM manager to come
online. But what does that mean for process and design technology?\
Not that you\'re responsible for that again, but I think getting you
coupled with this group is pretty important.\
So that\'s a statement to say in that meeting too.\
So when we talk about AI.\
As it relates to how we do our work better, right?\
So that form will be an opportunity to to solidify a partnership.\
And when we talk about generative design.\
I\'m going off script at R&B, but they\'re not so good. There\'s some
other things there, right?\
Well, man.\
Have you seen the new the new forum forma? No. Is it good?\
Or not. Oh, it\'s like then the guy drawing on the iPad with his with
his Apple pencil and it\'s making the floor plan.\
That\'s cool. Yeah. It\'s format or forma. Forma. Forma. I have that on
my iPad. No, it was like, it was kind of like they\'re like what\'s
coming in like 20/20/27 or something. It was like one of those future
hype reel things that they got.\
Um.\
So.\
That is one thing in the design form. I always kind of lead this session
about what\'s next.\
Um.\
Some of that is software like the VR, right, 360, whatever, right. That
would have come up in that session. And so I would imagine and Logan is
has been a part of the forums too, so he\'ll be there as well.\
In terms of what\'s next for you and Logan?\
So yes, research and benchmarking.\
And then what else?\
Right. So four months, that\'s one.\
And it\'s the same for watching Terriers. What\'s next?\
That\'s how Wendy got here. FFNE also two years ago in our forum, we.\
Brought up the idea. Let\'s talk about interiors outside of what you do.
Like if I look at a lot of people\'s websites, specifically Perkins and
Will.\
Environmental graphics is pretty Dang important, right? I mean, it
really makes the space. Outside of that, it\'s just a bunch of white
walls and.\
Pretty well put together architecture, but what makes that image
important is what\'s on that wall or whatever, right? So that\'s the
what\'s next for interiors. Just give me some Nuggets to think about.\
And so by doing that, you\'re empowering people to help push.\
So it\'s not just in your head, it\'s the job on my trip. There you go.\
Which I wanted to do, yeah, because that\'s how you can see the all of
the the research pieces that are not on projects being exactly. So if
it\'s an important investment for Pfluger.\
Like to level our game, right? So for FF&E, we know that\'s a pretty
important component to all our buildings and every client\'s asking for
it, but it\'s a it\'s a time suck.\
We need someone that just focuses on that. Mm-hmm. Right. So.\
What is that software that\'s gonna make us better? Or what\'s next?
Um.\
AutoCAD to Revit, right? Big deal, but it\'s making our life better. A
little clunky at first. You know all that. That\'s why you\'re leading.\
All right. Well, I got, I got a lot of, a lot of good feedback. Got all
my questions answered. We\'ll keep it going. Yep. OK, so we can touch
base once you get those answers or if you\'re not getting answers.\
Um, we\'ll go from there. OK. Yeah, I\'ll just try to keep chugging
along as best as I can. Yeah. Um.\
And then get it rolled out. Yeah.\
OK, man, roll. All right, audio. Switch software first. Yes. Gotta get
my. Yeah, I have a feeling crying as I\'m working on it. It\'s like
he\'s just got so much. Well, he\'s just, he\'s got a lot.\
Where is it at? I don\'t know that well. I just know things take a
little bit of time, you know. Yeah, it\'s like, oh, let\'s get this ring
in the draw, but it\'s the draw. Well, wait, let me see, he
understands.\
Right, so.\
Yeah.\
Alright, good.\
So, oh, so you can.\
Um, I don\'t think we right now. I don\'t actually.\
No, nothing there. OK.\
We need this week to keep up with it. I think you didn\'t have
background.\
Yeah.\
So there\'s there\'s research for benchmark that will back here with the
for the project numbers. Is there a specific project within management?
Yes. OK, yeah, yeah. So there it\'s like X25-RB and then a number.\
And the concept behind this was to structure the research projects to
align with our project structure for like regular architecture projects.
They had like some numbers like design, set and development structure
documents and the research projects load in that same type of manner.\
We can mirror and parallel them up with projects. Where is it? I mean,
are we talking hours? Are we talking expenses or? Um.\
Potentially both because starting. So back last year we had a bucket of
hours that related to the RB effort. Some of that we shifted as much in
as best possible to the projects, but.\
We coded at the end of the year RB effort. So on Katherine\'s working on
her research efforts, she had a code to go to, right? So what we want to
do is still try a key weight bucket of hours allocated.\
And then how do we?\
How do we anchor that with time and labor? So we\'re trying to track
hours in the.\
Overhead. Mm-hmm. Indirect kind of sorting out. OK, but quickly tie as
much as through the projects. Now some of it\'s not fun. We\'re gonna
have an application process schedule, so we can be able to be the
gatekeeper of that as much as possible, so we\'ll know how much
investment we\'ll have at the very beginning.\
But I know it\'s something that\'s really important. We had 2000 hours
dedicated last year. We used 762. So there we are. Those hours are worth
\$5050.00 an hour.\
And where are there\'s costs being couched? Is it changing in direct
overhead? So then we need to make sure that project gets mapped to the
CPU. So overcooked that projects are out there. You don\'t. That\'s
that\'s gonna be the allocation process.\
So it could be one or two and that\'s we\'re gonna be the gatekeepers of
that. So we can help regulate time and hours, but I think still trying
to capture that but vested as much as because as we\'ve realigned time
sheets the build structure.\
We would call those not sure how now the client project, how that\'s
been that they did look at all those not in the client projects that
might exist to make sure that they\'re mapped.\
Yes.\
Yeah, it\'s worth it.\
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I don\'t think we want to die on the line as we got
a lot of.\
I\'ve executed off a lot of those projects. I can get you all the
project numbers if that would help, or the structure behind them. What
we need to do is have that with Phil Sale map all those to CNPs.\
Those will be the existing fabrics. Um, there will be new projects.\
We\'re revamping for them here. So the ones that are out are sunsetted.
Let\'s see if these lifting ones are under X25 under our old formatting
structure where it was an X number was I believe it was an overhead
number and then the 25 is the year.\
So we predefined ten of them. So it was like X25 RV 010203 and we could
certainly rebuild them out like a list, like a section of them.\
We can. We roughly know how many there will be, and if we can just set
them up, then I guess I\'m not sure how the mapping works or anything
beyond that. Yeah, I don\'t. We\'d have to get that involved. Yeah, make
sure to for landing.\
Yeah, right place.\
Is it basically just shaking up the entire board and?\
Remapping. Thanks.\
This week? Sure. Well, I guess this was better late than never. I\'ll
shake it up.\
What? What information do you need from me? Do you? I guess do you want
a list of project numbers? I can circle back with that and say these and
what else is out there that\'s not client related as a project that\'s
not client related.\
And then we need to make sure it\'s mapped to the right call center,
like the the right department, yeah.\
Yeah, it\'ll be.\
Would it help to know the sub numbers of all those and estimate like
hours about how much each one would be potentially? Why no? I think I
adjusted the population of the projects OK and then we can.\
Yeah. How many of those are still active? So we\'re up to, I believe 11.
So that was for the existing ones. And then for new ones, if it\'s 2000
hours, roughly maximum be 200 hours, so 10 projects. So it\'d be like 10
to 15 projects for 26.\
OK, so who set this up? Currently I don\'t have permissions in vantage
point cinema. Previously Jack had set all of them up, but those were the
I believe it\'s between X01 and 11 or don\'t know.\
So yeah, to learn about, you know, we\'re gonna get a resource that\'s
gonna like the goal of having our locals finish going slash business
analysts, somebody that can handle the tech side and share the business
side, the reporting side and make sure that the inputs are.\
Going to the right place so things don\'t get screwed up. Mm-hmm. Who is
inserting the the projects in the project managers? Project managers
from a client standpoint, yeah.\
So I think we probably need to somehow get those efforts your belt where
you can insert that advantage point for advantage point. I\'m
technically a project manager. I don\'t think I have the ability to
create them.\
OK, here we go. Those are all think about all the stuff that that that
Jack did to make sure that. Mm-hmm. This tool had the right permissions.
Yeah, there\'s a lot the right mapping, like all of that.\
We don\'t have and I haven\'t, you know, I know PRP for the reporting,
but I don\'t know the back end of how everybody needs to be built. So
it\'s we we work through an outside consultant that it\'s for sale.\
OK, OK.\
He\'s a local subject matter expert and I need to bring some of that. I
need to get trained up more on it, but go to all of that.\
We\'ve always leaned on people for that. I mean, I think that\'s the
biggest thing. It\'s just the allocation of dollars and effort. It\'s
actually coding.\
For the projects to come, talk with Terry briefly.\
But we, like I said, had buckets of hours. Just wanna make sure they
don\'t get a box for all that stuff. So yeah, there is she talking today
on the new. Yeah, because we\'re about to go.\
Yeah, I think that slows anything down. It\'s just not the framework for
it. It\'s unfair.\
Planning in the planning, because you have, yeah, we\'re just kind of
setting up bucket, not the world. Can you use all that bucket as people
so we can\'t.\
The efforts for the historically that groups and never each get no
watch. Now we\'re setting and bringing idea character in a group or not.
The panel has said that idea is worthy investment or doesn\'t really
help us out as a firm.\
Go and then they are providing in that application estimate of hours,
time, effort, people, team. This is hopefully it\'s a business job
really. What\'s your business plan to act on? Yeah.\
Time is that. So that\'ll help us frame the investment fees. So OK, we
got the 2000 hours. It\'s gonna be all that out or is it? So we\'re
gonna be gatekeepers of that, but just getting the structure in there,
we\'re trying to finalize our budget, obviously.\
So I\'ll work on that if we can then. So our next step would maybe be.\
Coding.\
Anything you need, what would you need? Well, getting a list of X
projects so that can validate about mapping to CMP. So that\'s and then
I guess getting the Tony or Matt or whoever does that sort of research
to determined.\
Mm-hmm. Did us trained on project set up? I mean, there\'s stuff that.\
Jackie, what\'s things slow down? I need to get trained up.\
Talking to Tony all the day, so I\'ll ask him to regards to that. I just
think it\'s just the allocation. We do any effort those X.\
Yeah, right now.\
Here, some of those should have already sunsetted.\
Yeah, all the continuation. Yeah, all the.\
So it\'s just important, yeah, for going forward, yes. And then probably
important to close those other ones out or yeah, make them inactive so
they don\'t charge. So just get with the team interactive. So it\'s
something to be a susceptible projects for the instance.\
So you have fun. Just kidding. OK, OK, I will find out. See you later.\
It\'s cool. Yeah, we really I think we need a full reimplementation
retrain.\
Yeah, well, I think we are. Yeah, why don\'t we train.\
So back to display and then.\
I have put all of the recorded videos. I transcribe them and they are
all in Gemini. There was an effort to kind of create a a trend model on
that that you can just chat with and and those say all the content of
the videos and everything. Yeah, yeah.\
Well, OK, point training. So that could be a nice brief person because
anything that exists, although sometimes they sunset, they are no longer
accessible, so.\
Yeah, put it on our. I don\'t know who you had to visit that account,
but it was pretty accurate. You can see, I didn\'t. I didn\'t even know
like how to set it up on my phone. So like, hold all the instructions
and do that.\
So.\
Uh, try to find that for you.\
See, I wasn\'t about this.\
Yeah, I don\'t know. Ask the AI, but also if it\'s some background. So
if there are any like pick ups or anything or I\'ll just interim
support.\
Do that now. Give me all the access. Thank you, Gordon.\
Oh.\
So.\
That was.\
Hello.\
Yeah.\
Goodness, I\'d.\
I\'ll I\'ll just check on that. I guess we keep this is you know
saying.\
Yeah, that\'s great.\
OK, so we can make.\
Well, I think that we should bring this.\
Sorry.\
Yeah, sorry, OK.\
OK.\
Right.\
Mhm.\
OK.\
Download it. Download it.\
It.\
I can\'t have this.\
Hello.\
So, so.\
I\'ll check each.\
What\'s your name?\
Can you hear me?\
Who should?\
Sorry.\
OK.\
Please.\
Yes.\
Thank you.
