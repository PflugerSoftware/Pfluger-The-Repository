Alex Wickes 6 minutes 55 seconds
My song give you the one second, one second side.
Alex Wickes 7 minutes
One momento, please.
Alex Wickes 7 minutes 39 seconds
And Josh said that he wanted to be added to the meeting, so I forwarded it to him. Then he let me know that he's driving today. What's that? I'm sorry. He wanted to. He wanted to join the meeting. Yeah, yeah. But then he promptly let me know that he'll be driving, so he won't be driving.
Alex Wickes 7 minutes 56 seconds
Catch him up to speed after this.
Alex Wickes 8 minutes 10 seconds
He can chime in at some point, Josh.
Alex Wickes 8 minutes 39 seconds
I'm going to get my car worked on today. Oh, you don't. Oh, you drive a Honda Civic, right? Yeah. No, not CRV. How do you like it? Oh, my gosh, dude, it is 10 out of 10. Yeah, really awesome. We said we got to get it worked on today. Yeah. So when I got it, I worked in the.
Alex Wickes 8 minutes 59 seconds
The deal to get like this aftermarket tailgate spoiler. Yeah. And I guess like a washer fell off of it. Oh yeah. And it's like rolling around inside. And so every time. Oh yeah, yeah, it goes up. It's like, I'm like.
Alex Wickes 9 minutes 15 seconds
I have a similar thing on my tailgate on my car, like a I guess a clip got loose or something like that. And so and so it's it's inside the panel, right? So and then every time I I turn or whatever I can hear and then but sometimes it'll like fall into the hole it's supposed to go.
Alex Wickes 9 minutes 34 seconds
Yeah, it goes away and it stays there. It's like, OK, I'm not going to mess with it. I'm going to leave it there. So, but yeah, I mean, I'll glue, go to just glue back on or something like that. Well, it's like I look for like anything to like open it up because I'm like, I'll just take the trim off and I'll just open it up and get the the frigging washer out. I'm like, I can't figure it out.
Alex Wickes 9 minutes 52 seconds
And like, it's like Chinese water torture and then it stops. Sometimes it'll stop. It's constant. And then it's like, you're just like at a light and you're like, and then it's like and you're like, oh.
Alex Wickes 29 minutes 25 seconds
So yeah, HBO, when the new Walking Dead came out, conveniently got more expensive. So yeah, I think and and that's however much we want to give away or not of it, right?
Alex Wickes 29 minutes 38 seconds
So and then so on the subscription I guess like scope piece. So when we met with um Carlos and uh.
Alex Wickes 29 minutes 47 seconds
He seemed that the facilities management was on par with the bond planning, like I guess capabilities like they have the bond planning problem, right, which is you know, estimating the I need an elementary school, how much is that going to cost, what's the inflation look like, etcetera, etcetera.
Alex Wickes 30 minutes 5 seconds
And he alluded to the other problem of the facilities management. Yes. So I think we then have like 2 sub domains inside of this thing where it's like one is estimating a building and the other one's estimating an ongoing building. Do we want to tackle both of those? Yeah, because ultimately, yeah, I think that's Part 2 is.
Alex Wickes 30 minutes 24 seconds
We've got Alpha who's going in, who's going to evaluate all their existing facilities. So Alpha's facilities management, VCI building estimation, correct. And we're bringing those pieces together, prioritization of those, right. And so that ultimately it's a.
Alex Wickes 30 minutes 42 seconds
It's a it's a management. We want to be able to let them manage a bond, manage their deferred maintenance, which is generally part of a bond, right. There's a way that that we can do that forming one another as well as look at total cost of ownership and so they can look at on the M&O side about how much is going.
Alex Wickes 31 minutes 2 seconds
Cost to run the building because of utilities and there's some utility implications and we can start to bake in things that let's enter this EUI versus this EUI. What does it cost per EUI?
Alex Wickes 31 minutes 17 seconds
Right. Energy intensity, right. And so Alpha concurrently do this. Alpha concurrently do this. Or is this the vision of what that it's a vision. It's a vision. Alpha does energy modeling, energy assessments.
Alex Wickes 31 minutes 33 seconds
CMTA does these energy assessments and so it's kind of using really probably more of a CMTA kind of used to build that side on the energy side and then but Alpha's got some experience with that too. So I'm just curious to see if there's a.
Alex Wickes 31 minutes 51 seconds
If there's sort of a collaboration that happens to make it better, but CMTA are the building scientists I trust on that side. CMTA also has performance contracting that I'm going to want to use to partner with Alpha. So we bring Alpha in.
Alex Wickes 32 minutes 9 seconds
And just like we did in in Liberty Hill, brought Alpha in to do assessments on buildings. They might go, you know what, we can't get a bond passed. So let's do a performance contract where we can come in and.
Alex Wickes 32 minutes 25 seconds
And make some adjustments. And so CMTA comes in and they evaluate it from the energy standpoint, right? One is Alpha looks at it replacing one for one. CMTA would come in now evaluated based on 1 + 1 to 3, right?
Alex Wickes 32 minutes 42 seconds
And then what's the energy cost? And then even develop, put together a contract where they they it's a performance contract. We'll put that in, make those changes. You don't pay for it, right? We just get the savings from the energy.
Alex Wickes 32 minutes 57 seconds
What is CMTA short for? That's it. That's just their company name. Yeah. So then does Alpha? Would we have to then license? Let me decide. So CMTA is our MEP engineer on middle and high school. Oh, OK Oh, MEP guys. OK, yeah, it probably stands for the.
Alex Wickes 33 minutes 17 seconds
Yeah, Chris, Matt, yeah, carrying out. OK, so that so that one would be. So then I guess like just trying to unravel the this like license thing, so.
Alex Wickes 33 minutes 31 seconds
Is Alpha bring their own cost at the table or is Alpha then have to talk to Vermilions to get costs? I think ultimately what we want to do is we want to get it from Vermeulence. So Vermilions, we would license cost of the buildings and of the pieces, correct? And we would have Alpha tell us how many pieces we need.
Alex Wickes 33 minutes 49 seconds
Yes. And then CMTA is.
Alex Wickes 33 minutes 54 seconds
An MEP engineer, which is a sub currently a sub consult to us, which would tell us what kind of pieces we need to drive a certain performance. They'll be looking at systems, building systems more so. So yeah, so somebody's got a.
Alex Wickes 34 minutes 11 seconds
They currently have a a 12 seer rooftop unit and we're gonna replace it and they're gonna also go, well, the going rate now is a 18 seer and they go, well, if you change your system altogether, right, more investment, we can drive that.
Alex Wickes 34 minutes 28 seconds
Utility cost down and so it's starting to look at the way we replace it kind for kind or do we replace it with something that burns better value?
Alex Wickes 34 minutes 38 seconds
Or is there something other system that would bring better value or solution?
Alex Wickes 34 minutes 45 seconds
Well, this is longer term play. Yeah, I think it's like get it up and running then would be to not really involve the CMTA portion. No. And it's no, no. And it's just the alpha. That's in Vermeulens. Yeah. Then we do the alpha.
Alex Wickes 35 minutes 1 second
Then we do the CMPA.
Alex Wickes 35 minutes 5 seconds
Or is it the other way around where it's Alpha's first? Because Alpha's the reoccurring problem. Alpha is Alpha doesn't benefit us in a lot a lot of times. It's the biggest. That's what that's what Carlos would pay for.
35:05
35 minutes 5 seconds
Yeah.



Alex Wickes
35 minutes 23 seconds35:23
Alex Wickes 35 minutes 23 seconds
So Alpha has cost in that they do. We just want to make sure it's we want to make sure we can provide more reliable information on it and package it in a way that Bermuda Alpha doesn't currently do that. They just go, here's the cost.

Joshua Sawyer
35 minutes 29 seconds35:29
Joshua Sawyer 35 minutes 29 seconds
Right.

Alex Wickes
35 minutes 39 seconds35:39
Alex Wickes 35 minutes 39 seconds
Of things and here's when we think things are going to break or things that are broken. And then Josh is kind of re move things around going, this is how I think we need to package it. And so we would be doing that. Alpha does provide costing for those that were relying on for now. And so we go, we'll rely on that.
Alex Wickes 35 minutes 59 seconds
Until we can get Vermutans past our stage of the game. Well, so I I like convoluted that. So I guess for like launching, so like the MVP, the minimum viable product that you can get to the guy, right? Is that then a facility's main maintenance app that has?
Alex Wickes 36 minutes 19 seconds
Bond and total building capabilities built into it or is it a building app with facilities maintenance on top of it? It's a build, it's a building app with facility maintenance on top of it.
Alex Wickes 36 minutes 35 seconds
So the most important thing for their clients is how do we manage growth and these bigger bonds, how do we manage that and then we can and insert these deferred maintenance in there as a component of it.
Alex Wickes 36 minutes 50 seconds
So there's the cost, there's the deferred maintenance that's that's a piece of it. The added benefit will be ultimately to be able to manage it more effectively. That's kind of a that's somewhat separate.
Alex Wickes 37 minutes 6 seconds
From it. So that would only target new buildings then well, but but the but the ability to have a maintenance tool to see how their existing buildings are are performing. You know how's the roof doing, how are the windows doing, you know do I, what's the drains around the building that will help inform them.



Joshua Sawyer
38 minutes 24 seconds38:24
Joshua Sawyer 38 minutes 24 seconds
2.
Joshua Sawyer 38 minutes 27 seconds
It.

Alex Wickes
38 minutes 39 seconds38:39
Alex Wickes 38 minutes 39 seconds
The man are going, OK, let's look down through there. OK, take this number and plug it in. So it's that would be an add-on that's that wouldn't want to drive. Yeah and and Alpa will provide some cost information but but you know and they may use Vermilions, they may use someone else to kind of and that's that's on that right so.
Alex Wickes 38 minutes 59 seconds
So but but so I think whatever cost that we get from Alpha, I think we may still get vermilions to say hey this is what we got. You know what's it look like to use to look at accurate to to help them to help us confirm or verify the data and the the thing that I need to do with vermilions.
Alex Wickes 39 minutes 17 seconds
And Alpha is bringing them together and let's talk talking about how we can make their data better. If they're going to partner just with us, now we have an opportunity to affect how they're the quality of their data. So let's say we we had that's that's the that's the structure, right. So we.
Alex Wickes 39 minutes 36 seconds
Talk to District A or like we have this tool, it does bond planning. On top of that it can help you with facilities maintenance and stuff if the primary structure of whatever this thing is they're only using like once every two years.
Alex Wickes 39 minutes 52 seconds
But the ongoing service that they would use every day as an add-on, shouldn't that be flipped?
Alex Wickes 39 minutes 59 seconds
To where then you can do your your ongoing maintenance of all of your buildings, even your new ones. And by the way, you can use that to plan for a bond rather than saying like this is built around planning for a bond. Oh, and by the way, you can then track all of your buildings. So two things while I think the while I think the other.
Alex Wickes 40 minutes 18 seconds
Would be something that's would be more regularly used. The other, the other part of the tool is what's going to bring more value to us to getting us in front of them to do the work and to build design the buildings. Ca cause cause the newer. Yeah cause some districts may are.
Alex Wickes 40 minutes 38 seconds
You may already have a tool in place to help them manage their different mix of. Yeah, they do that. There's different software that uses all this bugs into. Yeah, does not have that tool. Yeah, yeah. So I think that's something to research because Alpha says we can bring, we have our data, we can have it imported.
Alex Wickes 40 minutes 57 seconds
There's so many different systems I go that we're familiar with that we can import into that. So there is already a management tool, sophisticated on that side. But what's missing from those is the costing tool. Yeah, the costing side of it. That's the part we want to bring.
Alex Wickes 41 minutes 16 seconds
So then I guess for this first round for this like MVP type of deal, we really don't need a lot of conversation then with alpha, no. So our main one would be just structuring how we want to license the data from vermilions in a way that oh by the way.
41:18
41 minutes 18 seconds
It.

Alex Wickes
41 minutes 32 seconds41:32
Alex Wickes 41 minutes 32 seconds
If we're then gonna work with another party, 'cause that keeps Alpha and Vermilions kind of separate, but they have to go through us. Yes. So they're not talking. I mean, it's like, you know, your MEP guy is not talking to your owner. They talk through you. Yeah. Oh yeah, because ultimately it could be.
Alex Wickes 41 minutes 48 seconds
Uh, Vermillans or Mulans is providing their licensing to.
Alex Wickes 41 minutes 54 seconds
Alpha. Yeah, but we would want it to go through us. Yes, agreed. And and but what you would need to know is I would want you to be up to speed where how Josh is using Alpha's data.
Alex Wickes 42 minutes 10 seconds
How he's manipulating the data if necessary, right? Mm-hmm. Plug it into a bot. So I think because Burnet is an example where we've got that information, we've it's become a a part of a bond for Burnet and so to see how.
Alex Wickes 42 minutes 26 seconds
That is being used and I think it's surely in the same case is this Josh.

Joshua Sawyer
42 minutes 33 seconds42:33
Joshua Sawyer 42 minutes 33 seconds
Yeah. Yeah. So I think, yes, it is. And I think the part that I'm interested in that maybe Alex, you're not fully following is in addition to everything that was just mentioned, we are using pricing from Vermilions on components.
Joshua Sawyer 42 minutes 50 seconds
To renovate and add additions to buildings that are also bond related that aren't just fixing a roof or you know, fixing some of the things in the building that we have a whole table of data on too. So you'd ask me like.
Joshua Sawyer 43 minutes 6 seconds
You know, what does it cost to to add these components to a building? This was a while back, but but we have all of that data and I think that at least initially my thought is to keep that very high level. That's where we're at now and then to get more granular. So like the CMTA thing would help us inform the cost per square foot for a building to build new.
Joshua Sawyer 43 minutes 26 seconds
say if it's 550 is the normal price for a normal building with normal MEP systems and in a regional factor that's, you know, relatively normal not, you know, something low or high. Then we add in that MEP data to help inform the systems cost for those elements that are
Joshua Sawyer 43 minutes 46 seconds
specific if a client prefers geothermal or something like that over other systems to then get to a more realistic cost. So I think my vision is that we have something high level, which we more or less have now. But ultimately, through multiple phases of this thing, we would be able to add more granular detail if so desired. It's not saying that
Joshua Sawyer 44 minutes 5 seconds
Every time we do this, we're going to get to that granular level, but we would have the ability to do that if we wanted to because of all of the maintenance and kind of system data that I think your maintenance side of this project.
Joshua Sawyer 44 minutes 22 seconds
Would have as part of the data.
Joshua Sawyer 44 minutes 26 seconds
Terry, does that make sense?


Alex Wickes 44 minutes 26 seconds
Yeah, because yes, it does, because I think ultimately the pods become a more granular approach. Yeah, that's more. Yeah, that's more aligned to like what Cameron's doing because. So Cameron is at that level. That's where he's at. So that's that's where it's like I'm confused and like the data that we're getting from.

Joshua Sawyer
44 minutes 41 seconds44:41
Joshua Sawyer 44 minutes 41 seconds
We're, yeah, we're like.

Alex Wickes
44 minutes 46 seconds44:46
Alex Wickes 44 minutes 46 seconds
Millions with the Sherryland stuff. And then what we're doing is we would then really just need to make sure from Blair that it's like we have all this data and it's great data. Is it the right data? Yeah. Are we getting it in the right way? And then are we gonna get it in a way that we can keep adding to improving?
Alex Wickes 45 minutes 5 seconds
Yeah, we would really want to make sure that if we start converting what we have to new data, then it's gonna work. Yes. Because it's like, yes, it sucks if we have all this data, but it's like if we try to shift it into something, yeah. And then it's like, Oh yeah, I gotta, you know, how much is to replace a roof on this project?

Joshua Sawyer
45 minutes 15 seconds45:15
Joshua Sawyer 45 minutes 15 seconds
I think.

Alex Wickes
45 minutes 25 seconds45:25
Alex Wickes 45 minutes 25 seconds
And then Vermilions is like, oh, there, buddy. And we're like, no, can we just put it into the thing? Yeah, that's all liability on us. And yeah, it's like we would want to make sure everything that goes in this app comes from that license from Vermilions. It doesn't. We should not be.
Alex Wickes 45 minutes 42 seconds
Yeah, whatever comes out. And if it is, we don't like it come the way we want it or we can't rely on it.

Joshua Sawyer
45 minutes 45 seconds45:45
Joshua Sawyer 45 minutes 45 seconds
No.
Joshua Sawyer 45 minutes 48 seconds
No, I think the way that the way that I've understood the data from Vermilions and I've and I've talked to them in the past. So you know Terry, I'd mentioned to you back in Brand XI had we had developed a licensing agreement with Vermilions to get something every quarter.
Joshua Sawyer 46 minutes 5 seconds
It was helping us with doing facility assessments because we were doing them in-house and with those they were giving us specific system costs, which I think are more aligned to what you guys are looking for. But ultimately all of that data can filter up to multiple levels. So you know if you think of a level one, is it cost this much to build?

Alex Wickes
46 minutes 9 seconds46:09
Alex Wickes 46 minutes 9 seconds
Uh.

Joshua Sawyer
46 minutes 23 seconds46:23
Joshua Sawyer 46 minutes 23 seconds
A new building that is an elementary school and you don't know what's in it. You know there's a cost for that or a range. They have ranges because they have multiple projects that they can use for the data points. But you could also take that same thing and say, well, this elementary school has these components. It has a cafeteria, it has a kitchen, it has academics.

Alex Wickes
46 minutes 32 seconds46:32
Alex Wickes 46 minutes 32 seconds
Mhm.

Joshua Sawyer
46 minutes 43 seconds46:43
Joshua Sawyer 46 minutes 43 seconds
It has a library and you can break it down to what I would call level 2, which is these pods, which is where we're at with the work that we've been getting from them to date. But even further from that you can break it down and they have all their data as part of the system analysis and.
Joshua Sawyer 47 minutes
Going through the the spec sections and all of that. So we've been able to get some granular data for specific things on that. And so for me, all of their data comes from the granular data. When you ask for an elementary school, it ultimately has all of the granular data feeding it to say that the elementary school cost 500 bucks a square foot.

Alex Wickes
47 minutes 17 seconds47:17
Alex Wickes 47 minutes 17 seconds
True.

Joshua Sawyer
47 minutes 19 seconds47:19
Joshua Sawyer 47 minutes 19 seconds
That's the data we're getting from them is the full gamut from level 1 to what I would call Level 3 for the various things that we want to be able to look at. And that would work for both your tool as well as my tool and other things that we're looking at. I I see this helping us and doing some cost estimating kind of in house.

Alex Wickes
47 minutes 20 seconds47:20
Alex Wickes 47 minutes 20 seconds
Mhm.

Joshua Sawyer
47 minutes 40 seconds47:40
Joshua Sawyer 47 minutes 40 seconds
During programming to do scope to budget because it's the same kind of tool. That's what I'm trying to think of is how can we get one set of data from vermilions that can feed all of these things and provide us the opportunity to to check and and execute the work that we're doing across the board.

Alex Wickes
47 minutes 59 seconds47:59
Alex Wickes 47 minutes 59 seconds
Yeah, go as deep as we need to because you're right, it is. It rolls up from granular data because they they go all the way down and then build it back up. And just to give you example that I I've just run it through that I got to get from you once to tell me is.
Alex Wickes 48 minutes 15 seconds
But CMTA says because this intrigues me. So, so Tavo is an MEP consultant and he says I'm going to charge you 3%. CMTA says I'm going to charge you 3 1/2%.
Alex Wickes 48 minutes 32 seconds
Well, I'm liking Tavo, but what CMTA where you said is right is Alex, you go, yeah, but for that 3 1/2%, I'm gonna drive down the cost of the MEP systems.
Alex Wickes 48 minutes 47 seconds
Shift it to the architectural so that the cost, if it's a $10 million project, you're going to do a 10 million, you're going to do 10 million, 35% of that or 25% is going to be MEP on Tavo's side and then 18 to 22% it's going to be on your side. So the ultimately.
Alex Wickes 49 minutes 7 seconds
We're paying more CMTA more fee to do to and we spend less money and here's a result of what happened in in Midland.
Alex Wickes 49 minutes 19 seconds
We go in on the project and the and the contractors going well based on this tonnage we need. It's 2400 tons.
Alex Wickes 49 minutes 29 seconds
And just based on normal square footage and CMC goes, Oh no, it's not going to be anywhere close to that. It's actually going to be it was 16 to 1800 tons. So it was far less tonnage than a typical building would have. And you go, this is good information, right?

Joshua Sawyer
49 minutes 43 seconds49:43
Joshua Sawyer 49 minutes 43 seconds
Which is less cost?

Alex Wickes
49 minutes 46 seconds49:46
Alex Wickes 49 minutes 46 seconds
And it's about driving the increase in lowering the energy cost, providing more on the on the making the building tighter and things like that. And so that's ultimately kind of where we get to on these value-based decisions. So, so just to to follow up on this like internal versus external piece of this.
Alex Wickes 50 minutes 7 seconds
Are we trying to make two different tools or one tool?
Alex Wickes 50 minutes 11 seconds
Because Josh, you had said my tool and then that tool. So are you making a different tool and does this app have to function in two different ways, one for internally and then like if you had like logins, right?

Joshua Sawyer
50 minutes 12 seconds50:12
Joshua Sawyer 50 minutes 12 seconds
One in my mind.

Alex Wickes
50 minutes 27 seconds50:27
Alex Wickes 50 minutes 27 seconds
Does does Cameron need to access the tool and it to work differently than dust? I don't either. I think it should work the same.



Joshua Sawyer
50 minutes 32 seconds50:32
Joshua Sawyer 50 minutes 32 seconds
I don't think so.
Joshua Sawyer 50 minutes 35 seconds
I I think it's all one tool. It's just that the the way you input the data. So you say I'm either doing an elementary school that's this much square footage or I'm looking at replacing a roof on an elementary school that's of this type of.
Joshua Sawyer 50 minutes 50 seconds
Of roof. To me the interface can be all the same. I mean it needs to be able to function for all of that. I do not want to do two different tools. I'm trying to say let's do one tool that can do all of this together, have one interface. And the tricky part of it is the interface needs to work for a very high level.

Alex Wickes
50 minutes 54 seconds50:54


Alex Wickes 50 minutes 56 seconds
Mhm.
Alex Wickes 50 minutes 59 seconds
Mhm.
Alex Wickes 51 minutes
OK.

Joshua Sawyer
51 minutes 10 seconds51:10
Joshua Sawyer 51 minutes 10 seconds
So it needs to be for someone who wants to come in and do a level one saying I want to see what it's going to take to add 100,000 square foot elementary school and what that's going to do to me. I know there was some other stuff y'all trying to do with this, but what is that going to do with me for maintenance down the road and all that and then?
Joshua Sawyer 51 minutes 26 seconds
Somebody coming in and saying, hey, I want to replace all the roofs in here. It's just the level of data that you're putting in, which I think goes back to some of the initial questions you asked me about what are the key questions that we need to ask the client.
Joshua Sawyer 51 minutes 41 seconds
Or have a client answer in order to be able to get arrive to the cost that they're looking to get. I'm doing the same thing.

Alex Wickes
51 minutes 42 seconds51:42
Alex Wickes 51 minutes 42 seconds
OK.
Alex Wickes 51 minutes 47 seconds
So.
Alex Wickes 51 minutes 50 seconds
So then I guess for this then, if we're wanting to just focus on with vermilions, we would only want this to be focusing on new builds then where if to have the ability for someone to come in and say how much is it to replace this roof in order for us if we're licensing that data from vermilions in a package, it would need.

Joshua Sawyer
52 minutes52:00
Joshua Sawyer 52 minutes
I don't think.

Alex Wickes
52 minutes 10 seconds52:10
Alex Wickes 52 minutes 10 seconds
Need additional parameters that Alpha would need to provide and if we don't have that then we would be making the assumptions on that which puts us in a pickle. So if we started this where it's just GTM, you know we're just going to these clients and saying here's our tool, this is a new build.

Joshua Sawyer
52 minutes 20 seconds52:20
Joshua Sawyer 52 minutes 20 seconds
I I don't.

Alex Wickes
52 minutes 27 seconds52:27
Alex Wickes 52 minutes 27 seconds
You know, Steve or Bobby gets in there and it's like, oh, how much is a new build? This is new project, blankety blank. But the features to do any sort of anything that would involve maintenance or additions or renovations or anything on the existing structures.
Alex Wickes 52 minutes 43 seconds
Would kind of be grayed out until that gets going and then Alpha gets on board. No, I don't think so. It is Vermilions would do anything that's additions, renovations and new builds and all.

Joshua Sawyer
52 minutes 50 seconds52:50
Joshua Sawyer 52 minutes 50 seconds
I don't think so.

Alex Wickes
52 minutes 58 seconds52:58
Alex Wickes 52 minutes 58 seconds
Because Alpha only looks at it as I'm going to replace that light with another light that looks just like it. And so there's the cost of each system individually, and then there's the cost of doing all the systems collectively, right? And so.
Alex Wickes 53 minutes 14 seconds
Alpha is really their value is going to be telling you what system needs to be replaced when. So they're the spec items. They're not going out and measuring like cracks in concrete, correct. They're just spec like specification items inside of a building. Yeah, that I think is is OK. What I see you have is you patch.
Alex Wickes 53 minutes 34 seconds
So you've got T8 fixtures and we're we're gonna replace it with T8 fixtures and then we're gonna go, OK, what if we want to replace it with AT with LED? OK, And then I'll go, OK, here's a crossword. That's gets granular with that. Got it? It's OK. We're going from a.
Alex Wickes 53 minutes 54 seconds
One to one to more value based at a system level from your lens that's going to be looking at it from a a division level, more of a you know.
Alex Wickes 54 minutes 7 seconds
I think that's what we talked about in our first meetings with Liberty Hill was the discussion of subscriptions, right. It's like the different tiers, right of of what of what that subscription will will get them right and what they can do with that tool. So and so let me give an example then of that is.
Alex Wickes 54 minutes 26 seconds
So let's take Burnet. So Burnet's got three buildings. I'm going to just say it's got three buildings in it, right? We're going to replace this building with a whole new building. Those that number is coming from Premier Lance. Then this building is going to get renovated to be like new, if you will.
Alex Wickes 54 minutes 45 seconds
Still an old building. It's like taking an antique, right? We're going to repurpose this old car, make it like new, still old, but like new for mules will provide that data because it'll be based on not a systems cost, but on a square foot cost. And then this building over here, we're not even going to use it for this new building or for this middle.
Alex Wickes 55 minutes 5 seconds
School. We're just taking it offline, but we're gonna use it for some, maybe some district stuff. So we need to we we gotta replace the mechanical equipment. So we would use Alpha's information for that. That's how that gets used.

Joshua Sawyer
55 minutes 21 seconds55:21
Joshua Sawyer 55 minutes 21 seconds
I think we can provide everything and and Alex, I think I just need to sit down with you and run through what that looks like with what Terry just explained. Alpha really honestly does something very similar to us. They just have people that go in and identify things that need to be taken care of.


Alex Wickes 55 minutes 37 seconds
Yeah. Facilities assessment. Yeah.

Joshua Sawyer
55 minutes 39 seconds55:39
Joshua Sawyer 55 minutes 39 seconds
Yeah, I can. I can help you work through this notion of high-level versus down to the nitty-gritty without them. So I don't think we'll need to Gray it out or anything like that. I think all they'll do is that once they're plugged in, we'll just need to be able to plug in their data.
Joshua Sawyer 55 minutes 57 seconds
And we have examples of their data so that we can understand how do we take the data that they've created and manipulate it in our tool without having to go in and hand input it.

Alex Wickes
56 minutes 9 seconds56:09
Alex Wickes 56 minutes 9 seconds
Yeah, really. The graying out piece is to keep it at the MVP state until we can iron out the workflow between US and Vermilions rather than trying to build every single feature into this thing. Agree. Yeah, yeah. And just to keep it super high level. Yeah, yeah. And then just get it to where it works and then.

Joshua Sawyer
56 minutes 21 seconds56:21
Joshua Sawyer 56 minutes 21 seconds
Yeah, yeah.

Alex Wickes
56 minutes 26 seconds56:26
Alex Wickes 56 minutes 26 seconds
This the ultimate goal then is Carlos can sit down and see it and say boop boop boop bink there we go because he's using a high level and I think I think so. Ultimately we're going to look you can we're going to give this tool so you can do stuff at a high level but also we can unlock things.
Alex Wickes 56 minutes 46 seconds
Things in the future that like you to go to much granular level and after you go to that much granular level, you might say, OK, you may want to hire us to do that right or we're so you can you can get a subscription to to build it or you can get a subscription to manage it.
Alex Wickes 57 minutes 3 seconds
And have us build it and that's we really hope they hire us to build it because then we're in there, it's all it's what we're doing with Burner, we're doing the bottom planning. So if we build it using that tool and then go, oh, by the way, we're going to give you this right here or whatever so you can help manage it and you.

Joshua Sawyer
57 minutes 13 seconds57:13
Joshua Sawyer 57 minutes 13 seconds
Right.

Alex Wickes
57 minutes 23 seconds57:23
Alex Wickes 57 minutes 23 seconds
And even then, as the next bond's coming around, you're starting to think of, OK, I think going to the new element, what is that going to cost? Oh yeah, I got the two of them. Yep. Yeah, definitely to create an ecosystem, yeah.

Joshua Sawyer
57 minutes 34 seconds57:34
Joshua Sawyer 57 minutes 34 seconds
Right. And I think the building part of it is how it operates on our end. I mean, we are the builders of all of this. They want to be able to see the data and understand it and manipulate it if they have questions.

Alex Wickes
57 minutes 35 seconds57:35
Alex Wickes 57 minutes 35 seconds
Yes.
Alex Wickes 57 minutes 46 seconds
So that I think that turns into do we not want the clients modifying the dials to where the only way that they can modify the dials is if they're with us. Give me an example of what when you modify the dial, what it does. So let's say if like when we're talking with.
Alex Wickes 58 minutes 6 seconds
Liberty Hill ISD, right? They're kind of in question about like what the student populations are, right? So he logs on to his, he bought the subscription and everything. And so he logs on and he says, oh, and he moves the slider from, you know, 600 students to 800 students.
Alex Wickes 58 minutes 21 seconds
And he sees all the prices updated and everything. Would we want him to be able to do that autonomously or would we almost act as like a consultant where he would say, oh, I'd like to see two different options between 600 and 800 and then you go out and meet with them, sit down and then you move it.
Alex Wickes 58 minutes 38 seconds
Because we don't want to have all the, I guess it's like the the person without the technical insight making the technical decision. So it's like Carlos may not know the difference between the two geothermal systems, but if he's just focused on cost, he's gonna put all the sliders to the left.
Alex Wickes 58 minutes 55 seconds
Where when we're starting this thing, we would, we would only want them to almost just be like viewing our results, so to speak.

Joshua Sawyer
59 minutes 4 seconds59:04
Joshua Sawyer 59 minutes 4 seconds
I would think they would need a sandbox of some sort. They're gonna want to play with it somehow, but it's just it's it's just seeing the data, not manipulating the data.

Alex Wickes
59 minutes 9 seconds59:09
Alex Wickes 59 minutes 9 seconds
I would think we don't want them to play with it.
Alex Wickes 59 minutes 18 seconds
Yeah, but they wouldn't be able to manipulate the data. Yes, we would not want them to do that. No, for sure. But I like the, I like the, I like the toggles though. If I'm going, if I'm gonna, I want 600 students to 800 students elementary schools, what do I think that's gonna cost?

Joshua Sawyer
59 minutes 21 seconds59:21
Joshua Sawyer 59 minutes 21 seconds
Right.

Alex Wickes
59 minutes 37 seconds59:37
Alex Wickes 59 minutes 37 seconds
Because then ultimately it's all going to still come back to you're working in a committee to build to build a plan.
Alex Wickes 59 minutes 50 seconds
And that plan.
Alex Wickes 59 minutes 52 seconds
Will be informed by this. So this is kind of what I was talking about like with the sliders. So this is this was updated with fake data. Is this on the call? Are you sharing that with him? Sure.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 10 seconds
Oh boy.

Joshua Sawyer
1 hour 11 seconds1:00:11
Joshua Sawyer 1 hour 11 seconds
And I just, I just arrived in Bryan. So I'm I have 30 minutes before I have to be in interview prep.

Alex Wickes
1 hour 17 seconds1:00:17
Alex Wickes 1 hour 17 seconds
OK, yeah, good luck today. Is that today or tomorrow? So this is kind of like kind of like our side here. So you have the base site design contingency. So looking at vermilions, they they give the data in like the ranges.

Joshua Sawyer
1 hour 21 seconds1:00:21
Joshua Sawyer 1 hour 21 seconds
Thank you.
Joshua Sawyer 1 hour 23 seconds
That is today.

Alex Wickes
1 hour 34 seconds1:00:34
Alex Wickes 1 hour 34 seconds
For the cost sections, it's like A2A3A3A4 and everything. So you would come to you know like shell and you know like structural frame like this would be like steel versus mass timber, right? So.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 51 seconds
Oh, got me kitten.

Joshua Sawyer
1 hour 53 seconds1:00:53
Joshua Sawyer 1 hour 53 seconds
So they already have to you almost a Level 3. The only thing that they don't have beyond this is like very specific, like being able to go in and dial something in very specific. But this is this is already like Level 3 data in my mind.

Alex Wickes
1 hour 59 seconds1:00:59
Alex Wickes 1 hour 59 seconds
So then you can modify it.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 1 minute 7 seconds
Yeah, if they're not manipulating the data, right? Yeah, through the data that we input there is accurate, right? In theory, right. So if they're just doing that and not manipulating the data itself, I I don't see a problem with them having to be able to.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 1 minute 22 seconds
Have this type of access or ability to do that, right? I think we wouldn't want them to get the impression though that the slide, the position of all their sliders is a good building. Does that make sense?

Joshua Sawyer
1 hour 1 minute 34 seconds1:01:34
Joshua Sawyer 1 hour 1 minute 34 seconds
I think you need to provide them data though. So like when you're on fixed equipment, we would need some information toggles to understand what is $4.00 versus what is $11.00, right?

Alex Wickes
1 hour 1 minute 41 seconds1:01:41
Alex Wickes 1 hour 1 minute 41 seconds
****.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 1 minute 43 seconds
Yeah, like they're like, oh, furnishings. I don't need furnishings. What are these furnishings? See. And what I would want to see is right to the right of furnishings. There's an I. And that I says this is generally the range for elementary, you know, middle high. Here's the difference. And so there's some educational component to it or picture.

Joshua Sawyer
1 hour 1 minute 54 seconds1:01:54
Joshua Sawyer 1 hour 1 minute 54 seconds
Yeah.

Alex Wickes
1 hour 2 minutes 3 seconds1:02:03


Alex Wickes 1 hour 2 minutes 3 seconds
This is what your cheap furniture looks like. This is what your yeah furniture looks like. Yeah. So I think it, I think there does need to be some informed message, but and if they use it to go down to the bottom, well, that's because they chose not to hire an architect, but what I worried about.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 2 minutes 22 seconds
Yeah, as I go through this is what we don't want them to do is go, you know, now that I got this fancy tool, I don't need Pfluger. Yeah, we'll just, we'll just, yeah, facilitate and get the bond planning ourself. Yeah. So I think that's where it where it gets back to like what I had asked about, you know, do we want them manipulating it or is this part of?
Alex Wickes 1 hour 2 minutes 41 seconds
The Pfluger service.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 2 minutes 44 seconds
A part part of that process built into a supplemental service in the contract that they sign is, you know, when we do bond planning, you know, we sit down and we have this tool that we use with you and then that way you're educating them at the same time of not having to do all the heavy lifting.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 3 minutes
And then, you know, you could have presets, you know, where you save like version 123. So would you be OK then that goes, OK, so when you hire us, we're gonna give you a copy of this tweet so that while we're doing work, you can be back at the office playing and go and kind of what ifs.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 3 minutes 17 seconds
You know, within the constraints that we allow, we would say for for interior doors, you don't get to touch that slider. Like when we talked about, you know, we were talking about, you know, HVA systems or let's say they're interested in mass timber, right. Then the only sliders that they can access are the ones that are particular to the like the the.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 3 minutes 36 seconds
Strings of the playpen that we've put them in and I I just my initial reaction though is if if they've hired us to do bond planning.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 3 minutes 47 seconds
I don't mind them seeing anything that we have to offer because it might generate conversations we might not otherwise have. And so because ultimately play all you want, but this is our we're going to together we're going to build what the official.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 4 minutes 4 seconds
Response is right and we can then work together to go. We think this is today and this is five years because we're going to do a 10 year plan. So we're going to do a five, you know today of five and 10 years and we'll build that together. But you go play all you want to see what that is and go oh the land and you know it's looking at the land is that land based on.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 4 minutes 24 seconds
Our prices here or there. And yeah, we've got to tweak that or your market. And they may know the answer faster than we do. Yes, because Dustin was like, I already got the land. It's zero. Yes. And so he moves the slider to 0. Yeah. And we're like, why don't you put it at 0? It's like, yeah, I already got it. I'm like, great. Yeah.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 4 minutes 42 seconds
OK, that helps. OK. But I think so that's intriguing to me is that we go. The only way you get this is if we're actively doing a bond program together. Yeah, it's an instrument. Oh yeah, for sure. You've hired us. You've hired us to do a bond program and.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 5 minutes 2 seconds
We're involved in the work that comes out. So we're gonna go, you know, because if it is, if, if, if you're hiring for this scope of work, you got the tool for the length of time of that. But if you got us for here, you get, maybe you get the tool for the length of bond as long as we're working.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 5 minutes 22 seconds
It's a part of it. Maybe it kind of renews with each project, if you will, kind of thing. So maybe it's tied to the work we're actually doing. Yeah, there is no subscription. Yeah, because it's like you're already paying us for it. And then it's just like, well, is your bond going to be a five year thing or is this like a two-month thing? Obviously the price changes.


Joshua Sawyer 1 hour 5 minutes 30 seconds
It's almost like modules.

Alex Wickes
1 hour 5 minutes 41 seconds1:05:41
Alex Wickes 1 hour 5 minutes 41 seconds
I think the only component I can see being on a subscription basis, the maintenance tool, right, the maintenance tool. So I think that could be, I see that reoccurring. Yeah, because it's like the bond things like once every three years or something. Yeah. And it does simplify if it's tied to our service to them. Yeah, because we could lock everything down.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 6 minutes 1 second
How about that? Yeah. And then just a subscription for that. OK, yeah. And I think, so let's say we're working with Dustin. We got this tool and all this stuff is cool and he's telling about it. So Del Valle goes.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 6 minutes 20 seconds
I want to see this and I want to, I want to give you some. Is there like you said, we got everything locked down so maybe he could go in and do some real high level stuff. We could set the play pen for you. Yeah. So it so we're building the hook. We're setting the hook, right. That's how I see this is almost like just the teaser trailer.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 6 minutes 41 seconds
Into what you're gonna get. Yeah, because for for us, the the level that entry to get it in front of somebody is just literally giving them a login. Like there's no work on our end, right? The traditional work is like, oh, I gotta drive out there. I gotta meet with them.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 6 minutes 57 seconds
Gotta figure out what his dog's name is, right? But this way it's like you could just send it to somebody and then they call you up. They're like, oh, this is really cool. What's this slider do? And then you're like, oh, well, I'll come over and come out and see how you're doing with it. Cause then it the people that may be looking at a bond may not be serious.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 7 minutes 14 seconds
I think you don't have to spend all your time chasing the people who aren't serious, but somebody who wants to sit down and look at it be like, Oh no, I actually we were talking about, you know, fittings and specialties because that was like a big issue in our last round. And then so I go talk to Dill Valley with it and they go, Yep, we want to hire you to do it.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 7 minutes 31 seconds
And they go, but we need a utility component to this. OK, we're gonna build that. We're gonna charge you a fair price for it. We're gonna use, build it on your back, if you will, right? Build it around them. And then and then we're gonna now it's an add-on.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 7 minutes 49 seconds
Yeah, that they can pay extra to get that piece. Yeah, I think that's a smart one too, because it it keeps our upfront development scope small and only the features that we're putting into it are the ones people are specifically asking us for, where it's not like us going like, oh, well, I use this asbestos, baby. Everyone would use that and it's like, no.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 8 minutes 8 seconds
Who cares about messages? But it's like, wow, in a specific area, they're really, you know, conscious about dust infiltration in their lobby spaces or something. And then it's like all the features you're putting in, people are paying you to put in.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 8 minutes 23 seconds
Because, I mean, we could blow this thing up and like to spend five years making the most perfect cost is main tool. But it's like if you're only 5% of the features, yeah, OK, so loving the idea of licensing the information. So I need a better understanding what that looks like.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 8 minutes 42 seconds
Seeing the information and if I'm reviewing, I'm good.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 8 minutes 48 seconds
I'm gonna give you this information at a at a low price.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 8 minutes 53 seconds
Thinking out loud here because I want to do cost estimating.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 8 minutes 59 seconds
And so is our tool their cost estimating service though? I don't think so. Do they perform their service? Like what additional estimating would they be doing on the project if we have this? Well, because we're gonna actually give them the documents and the the.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 9 minutes 18 seconds
The information that's feeding into our actual design. So it's now tailored to that specific project. So this this tool's helping them create the bond right and and set up set budgets right and so you start to tighten the potential cost of their building.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 9 minutes 37 seconds
To get we get project out of that those bond projects, right? We get one and then now we use Bert Williams to help us in the design process. Cuz generally it's the construction manager's response for the cost. Yeah, he's not using this tool. Yeah, they're using their own data. Yeah, we're validating the data with someone.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 9 minutes 57 seconds
We trust because we don't want to have to do redraws and they just got so much more feeding it. So now it is, I believe it's going to be they made some assumption based on we think there's going to be this much tonnage.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 10 minutes 12 seconds
Right. Because they're going 2400 tons. I know now it's 1600 tons. So they're going to be tweaking that to be specific. And then once we bid it, they're going to take that information, right, plug it in. So now their data is more accurate.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 10 minutes 29 seconds
Right. Once the project's bid and so they'll go, these are assumptions of what the cost was going to be in this, right. So let's say we think it's $500 a foot. Well, when we get into the project and because we based it on their last elementary school, $500 a foot, that's what it came out to or let's say.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 10 minutes 48 seconds
$513 So now we plug that in. But then as we go through this process, we've added solar. There's other expectations that now have because of the new code, it's driving things up 10 bucks a foot, 24 codes driving things up. And so now they're going, Oh yeah, so now they're going to bake that into that project if we think.

Joshua Sawyer
1 hour 11 minutes 8 seconds1:11:08
Joshua Sawyer 1 hour 11 minutes 8 seconds
OK.



Alex Wickes 1 hour 11 minutes 8 seconds
This cost from 513 is now 523. And then when the project bids at 517, they're going to go. There are some assumptions we made that weren't quite right to what the market really did. And so now we're going to refine that number 517 that goes back into this that everybody the whole world.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 11 minutes 28 seconds
To see and it's it's keeping that information accurate more and more. So we would pay for millions for two independent services, the first service being the license agreement of the for that first stuff. The second one would then be a contract that we would sign for a specific project, correct.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 11 minutes 48 seconds
We typically do those contracts with vermilions right now. Is that through just invoice like bottom dollar flat flat item or is it like hourly? It's a it's a it's a based on percentage of the.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 12 minutes 3 seconds
It's either a percentage of the value or a cost per square foot, but I think it's a percentage. It's like generally like 2% of the, you know, the other project cost, 2% of our fee and 2% of the project cost project cost, yeah. So they act almost as a they act as like a.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 12 minutes 23 seconds
Correct. Yeah, typical consultant, but for them. So this I guess then to to speak to what they're getting out of it, if our tool is helping us to essentially build more expensive buildings, the fee that they would get if if we contract with the client is their 2%.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 12 minutes 42 seconds
Is now worth more than just a typical 2%.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 12 minutes 48 seconds
I think what it, I think what it means is I go from 0% to 2% because now they're going to get the work. So would we only then use vermilions on projects that we've secured with their licensed data? No.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 13 minutes 4 seconds
We would use them regardless. We would use them regardless. So for them to then license the data to us at a discounted rate really wouldn't affect them.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 13 minutes 14 seconds
Any addition work they would get well, you know, so good point is.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 13 minutes 23 seconds
What they're doing, this licensing of this data, is building confidence in us and our team to get the project. Yeah, it's built well, building confidence in us that they're the right guys because they're going to give us the best.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 13 minutes 38 seconds
Service because they know the project and all the best. So they're this investment they're making is getting them down the road further than a PCR is. PCR is coming in cold because we're doing this. They're going to be jumping to give us the information we want quicker. They're going to be doing this post assessment evaluation.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 13 minutes 58 seconds
We're not going to pay extra for that.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 14 minutes 3 seconds
And I think so.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 14 minutes 6 seconds
So I think that our commitment is that you're working with us on this. So do if you're if we're using your data, we're committed to use you to do the cost estimate, but we can use anybody we want.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 14 minutes 23 seconds
Yeah, but if we license your data, then we're going to use it. Yeah, we're, yeah, we're, yes. On another project that's not them, we may go with PCR.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 14 minutes 35 seconds
We may go with someone else and there's some people that go, we gotta go, we gotta use a minority for right or something. Yes, yeah, like or something. And so I think we're committed to work with them anywhere where we're using this tool and they earn the opportunity to work with us on other projects.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 14 minutes 55 seconds
Out of, you know, goodwill and trust and those sort of things. So like right now for.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 15 minutes 5 seconds
Oh yes. So they did it as a percentage of that.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 15 minutes 9 seconds
They did it as a percentage of our fee.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 15 minutes 12 seconds
Because let's say at LCAR. So we go, what's your fee? We go 40,000, Oh yeah, so we're 2% of that. So we're going to charge you $800 to do a cost estimate where let's take the same building. So we're a project where we're getting paid $1,000,000.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 15 minutes 33 seconds
They're getting 2%, if you will, of that. So they are keeping that same deal because they're buying in to the opportunity to actually do the work. So even when we don't use this tool, if they help us with the costing, then we're more likely to use it.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 15 minutes 52 seconds
We won't be coming up to use them. Are we able to tell them then we have like an estimated growth in projects by using this tool to give them like an incentive of saying like, you know, because it's kind of.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 16 minutes 7 seconds
Off of a win for them, right? Like if they're like, well, I mean, if you're gonna use this regardless, why should we give you a discount on this data?


Alex Wickes 1 hour 16 minutes 16 seconds
But then we would us would be saying, well, if you give us this, if you if we buy this data deal or something and we plug it into this thing, this allows us to secure work faster. I think that's extensive work therefore.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 16 minutes 32 seconds
That part of the deal is, you know, you're gonna be a little grind place on those. So it's like if our if our tool allows us to only do inland sized high schools, right?
Alex Wickes 1 hour 16 minutes 44 seconds
Then their incentive is to go with us on that because they're supporting that route and that target.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 16 minutes 54 seconds
Yeah.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 16 minutes 56 seconds
But I think here will think out loud. So in Liberty Hill.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 17 minutes 2 seconds
We're saying we're gonna, you're gonna, we're gonna license the data and we may even say.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 17 minutes 10 seconds
This is, I I can't say that this is you know they if we pay them to license the data and we say by licensing the data they have to keep it up to date and when we go get with a client and we said OK, we're gonna tailor this to your building type.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 17 minutes 30 seconds
Right. Here's the, here's what the market is saying. Average cost per square foot in an elementary school is this to this. We want to put it up. We want to know what their elementary cost for the past when they did. So they're going to take that, they're going to build an estimate from it.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 17 minutes 46 seconds
And they're going to plug that in and make adjustments. So we're going to want them as a part of paying them for the licensing to to to provide current data that matches what's being built and what the standards are in that club in that district. So for Liberty Hill.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 18 minutes 4 seconds
We're going to pay you for the data. Let's say we pay you for the data, but in paying you for the data, we're going to give you a copy of a high school, a middle school and elementary school. You got to plug that in and tailor it to the to what the district wants. And when they say we also want, we're going to use this drop down and we want to do mass timber.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 18 minutes 23 seconds
You're making sure that we've got the latest data to make sure that we that that happens. So the data to them is extremely valuable because they use that data to sell to other people. That's the biggest thing they got this data. This data makes it so much better. So could we?
Alex Wickes 1 hour 18 minutes 40 seconds
I guess I don't know how you feel about this one is to literally just say it's a trade. I think it could be that we're not licensing the data because we're technically giving you free money that's in an infinite money machine, right? That's true. Like if they because I mean they got the Liberty Hill high schools.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 18 minutes 56 seconds
Any district that calls them up, they can use that data with them. So then I guess when it would we then also don't want to say in our licensing thing like.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 19 minutes 7 seconds
Like we give them their, we we give them the school data set, right? That goes into their whole database. When we license it, are we saying we only want you to use the schools we give you or do we want to use all of the schools that you have in your entire warehouse? All the schools I have to use them.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 19 minutes 24 seconds
So then I think it would be then logical to say like if if you're putting that school into your big data set, then we get the whole data set back. Yeah. And then what is then the price then of the license, the data that you're giving us back versus?
Alex Wickes 1 hour 19 minutes 39 seconds
The, I guess the investment or the the value of the buildings that we're giving you and are those equal or less than and that is and that is my hope is that we're not paying them anything because they're getting value with the data because what we're going to say is we're going to give you.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 19 minutes 57 seconds
This project and this cost us, this cost, you know the cost of payout and you didn't have to go, you didn't have to go build that from scratch. No, we got it. They got it for free. You got it for free. Now you get to use that data to help inform your other work and that's where I think and and we're going to say.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 20 minutes 16 seconds
We're not locking that data down. That data is yours to go use it. And I want dripping Springs to put their numbers in here, right? I want them to use that because they're going to add numbers in and I want Del Valle to add numbers in and Dustin wants it because because I want to know what this market is costing.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 20 minutes 34 seconds
And I want to know how my buildings are comparing to in the market and he goes, I need everybody else's data. So, so I guess and then I guess just thinking out loud on this because this, this is the fascinating piece of this thing, right? So if let's say we stopped using verbillions.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 20 minutes 50 seconds
Then.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 20 minutes 52 seconds
All of the data that we've given them, they will technically get to keep. Yeah, or do we say and vice versa?
Alex Wickes 1 hour 21 minutes 1 second
Well, so the but the data that they give us are curated numbers, not from their hard data tables, correct. It's a it's a point in time to that point in time of all this data, but for them they would get to keep it, yes. So I guess then would be one of the instructionists were.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 21 minutes 17 seconds
The because like we give them our projects, right? But ultimately we're giving kind of like public work like like it's owned by the government because it's the school of the plan and everything.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 21 minutes 29 seconds
We we then want to like track that in their data set and say like if we stop using you, you gotta delete that.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 21 minutes 36 seconds
No, I don't think so because then that would keep us along for the ride on their boat because the data we provide them as well. That's also just a one time as well because they still use it to, yeah, but but the way costing changes almost monthly, you know.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 21 minutes 54 seconds
That that data is going to be old by the time. So if let's say we stop using them for this tool, but they're still going to be pricing a project for us down the road. We want that data baked in there because that'll give us the.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 22 minutes 11 seconds
We want to make sure our our numbers were given are good, but do we want to tie our name to it rather than we kind of just like give it to them again and they throw the ball into the ball pit?


Alex Wickes 1 hour 22 minutes 23 seconds
Because if we leave, the ball's still gonna be there and regardless even if it's old data or not. But for us that, I mean, I don't know how much they buy data for, but I mean if we get a price for the back that way on the services that you make, right? Because if you give them like a bulk deal in like 100 projects.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 22 minutes 42 seconds
Right. To them they can use. They're using that data. Definitely they could go to anybody in their mother. So is that now? But though isn't that the partnership that they it makes them better everywhere they work and this?
Alex Wickes 1 hour 22 minutes 58 seconds
And for us, we're getting in front of them, but it's good data to bring a unique value to our clients and they're also giving us data that we don't have knowledge of either. So, so instead of, you know, getting data for the five projects that we got from the New Hill, now we're getting data from the projects that they're working on. So, so that's kind of.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 23 minutes 18 seconds
I agree. And what I what I don't know where there's opportunity, I think is as Blair's going, how do we use this in New York? Yeah.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 23 minutes 30 seconds
And how can we benefit or benefit from that? So let's say they're in New York and we're not, right? We're not going to be doing bonds and whatever else, right? So how do we benefit in that case where they're using the tool?

Alex Wickes 1 hour 23 minutes 45 seconds
And but we're getting a royalty or something. There's some money back to us, right? Go use it where you want to use it right outside the state. We just want that regardless. So if you do an estimate with a Pfluger building.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 24 minutes
In it then we are, I mean, we're part of that estimate and you got that for three. Do we get a royalty? Like would you have to license those back to us? Yeah, like instead of us giving them all the data, we license it back.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 24 minutes 16 seconds
Maybe so.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 24 minutes 19 seconds
Because I think what he's wanting to go build for everybody else is we don't need to go build it. It already exists.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 24 minutes 26 seconds
It just says Fleuron or it says prison.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 24 minutes 33 seconds
In every state but Texas, until we moved to another state and now it's Pfluger and right and Louisiana.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 24 minutes 46 seconds
Maybe there's some way that that because there's, yeah, there's some way that we want to make sure we get credit for it. We don't need credit in Iowa, but we do need credit for it all across Texas.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 25 minutes 1 second
OK, so yeah, get next next conversation is to talk to Blair about licensing. What are the scopes around that? So the last item for this one is so Blair.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 25 minutes 15 seconds
There's other dogs at Vermilions besides Blair that he talks to, like his boss, etcetera, etcetera. Are we making all of these conversations with Blair or Vermilions? Like, is Blair talking for Vermilions?
Alex Wickes 1 hour 25 minutes 33 seconds
Have you talked with anybody else at Vermillions besides Blair? He's always been the highest I've ever talked to. So then I guess we're talking about these grandiose licensing agreements and all this stuff. Do we then need to have like a big sit down? Cause he's, I mean our last call he was talking about like, yeah, you know, I got to go talk to my guy.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 25 minutes 52 seconds
About this, make sure it's three, but we're not talking about them, so I don't know if we're still talking through Blair.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 26 minutes 1 second
I think we're talking through Blair as we're figuring this out together. I think there's a point in time here in the very near future to your point is, OK, who's going to sit down? Let's talk through the net, through the nuts and salts of this. Yeah, because the other one is if Blair is kind of using this as his own career project.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 26 minutes 20 seconds
Rather than us with vermilions. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 26 minutes 25 seconds
I don't know. It could just be something to explore. At some point you're going to have some more conversation with them because you know there is no agreement right now. I was trying to will be the agreement. So correct. So yeah. So I think before that happens we need to work out all these little, yeah, issues, right. Yeah.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 26 minutes 41 seconds
So, yeah, so shoot him an e-mail then be like, hey, we want to explore this in 26, want to explore what licensing your data looks like. Yeah, let's talk about how to use it to benefit from the partnership, right, if you will.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 26 minutes 58 seconds
Because I think, I think we do need to talk about it. What does it look like in the use of Texas and what do we expect to get from them? What do they expect to give us? What do we expect them to give us and do for us? Yeah. And then if they were to go.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 27 minutes 14 seconds
Man, rather rebuild this, I'll just go.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 27 minutes 17 seconds
Maybe I'll just go sell this tool, sell the use of this tool in other states with other architects. Yeah, but but if we're licensing the data, they're not part of the tool building. No, that would be the tool.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 27 minutes 33 seconds
They could be a.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 27 minutes 35 seconds
Third-party seller of the thing, right? Oh, they would license it all from us. Yes, why don't we just license it to other people then? Well, because he'll be the one out selling it because he's out all over the country, Vermeulens across, across the country and.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 27 minutes 53 seconds
We don't. We don't care. I don't think we would want to do that though. Why not? Because if he would technically be bringing in revenue for the product that he's licensing, that'd be like a franchise, it's the money's flowing back to us.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 28 minutes 11 seconds
Would it be? I don't know. I don't know. Regardless. Yeah, I know. To me, I think that's the second that's another that's another opportunity because then he would want to own it. It would be easier for him to own it and then sell his product that he owes equity in rather than.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 28 minutes 27 seconds
Like opening a Chick-fil-A.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 28 minutes 30 seconds
He seemed pretty excited about opening Chick-fil-A.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 28 minutes 34 seconds
Yeah, I.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 28 minutes 38 seconds
You want to add that to the conversation or just tackle? No, I think we should because he talked about it going to doing it as a national thing.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 28 minutes 47 seconds
'Cause he? Yeah, he's he's not limited to education in Texas. I think there's Vermilions nationwide. Yes, everywhere. Mm-hmm.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 28 minutes 59 seconds
And they brought in like a we're going to use a guy, a theater guy from Florida, because he was most knowledgeable about theaters.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 29 minutes 16 seconds
What do you think of them?
Alex Wickes 1 hour 29 minutes 19 seconds
Fortune you get the pray for it. It's a doozy. So I guess do we want to send that e-mail, Blair through you in Claire? Yeah, I think that's the ideal way to get with Claire and just.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 29 minutes 35 seconds
Allude to, yeah, talking about possibility of licensing and continue the conversation on the partnership and what this looks like in 2026. Yes, along with Neylan down her name disclosure. Got that? OK, it is.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 29 minutes 51 seconds
Yes, it will. But I think, yeah. So we're going to take Blair to the far and the woodshed followed up on the NBA.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 30 minutes 4 seconds
You'll just meet right here for our deal, OK.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 30 minutes 13 seconds
Need to touch base with Lauren on all this? No. What happened?
Alex Wickes 1 hour 30 minutes 18 seconds
On just like how this is operating, any money stuff, contract stuff, operation stuff.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 30 minutes 25 seconds
Making these agreements stuff, you know, because right or if like you need to talk to anybody else. No, I think it whenever we start to getting to let's talk about attorney step, I think because she's responsible for owning that piece. Yes. And because if we're gonna right now.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 30 minutes 45 seconds
Investment is your time, right? And we've.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 30 minutes 51 seconds
Right. We're not counting your time and projects and all. We're just going. That cost is big debt. Wherever you spend your time is your time. So there's not a budget component until we agree if we're going to start paying for paying, it's billed to the project if it's if we're paying somebody.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 31 minutes 8 seconds
Help us build this.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 31 minutes 11 seconds
We need to plug something into the budget, but my anticipation is we're not paying them anything to build this. We're just licensing it. It was only if we had to go to that third party. But we don't think we need to do that, do we? It just depends on how complicated the thing gets. OK, so we'll figure it out when we cross that quick. All right.
Alex Wickes 1 hour 31 minutes 31 seconds
What is it? Yeah, cross the bridge when we come to it. Yes. Yeah. Or you just go first one. Yeah, sure. Oh boy. OK.
