# SECTION 1: VISION & FRAMEWORK

## 1.1 Vision Statement

The application of architectural research into built works assisted by computational intelligence.

## 1.2 Core Principles

### 1.2.1 The Why: Alignment with Pfluger Core Values

Research and benchmarking is a way to live out the Pfluger core values: Do What's Right, Build Synergy, Make a Difference, and Never Settle. When these are used to focus on problems, novel solutions can occur, discovering the 'What's Next'.

The R&B Framework exists to aid in the research process, so you can enjoy the creative exploration without getting tied up in the busy work. Novel research isn't just seen as a marketing strategy; it can serve as a creative outlet for architecture that isn't on a project.

While escaping to Mars sounds great, a focus of the Pfluger R&B is to link it back to our work under the focus of Experiential Learning and how we can use this new knowledge to better our built environment.

The R&B department operates on the principle that research should directly inform practice. By systematically investigating questions related to experiential learning environments, Pfluger positions itself to lead rather than follow industry trends. This approach serves multiple purposes: it creates competitive advantage in project pursuits, develops internal expertise that elevates design quality, provides professional development opportunities for staff, and generates publishable thought leadership that raises firm visibility.

Research at Pfluger is not an academic exercise disconnected from delivery. Every research initiative is tied to either an active project where findings can be immediately applied, or a strategic area where future projects are anticipated. This ensures research investment yields tangible returns in built work quality and client value.

### 1.2.2 The Focus: Experiential Learning in Educational Architecture

As architectural trends constantly shift across all sectors, the current objective is the evolving philosophy of experiential learning. This can be divided into many topics and subcategories, but it revolves around the experience of education rather than memorization.

While the educational pedagogy is on the educator's side, the physical space is the special stage that the architect can curate. With a new flexible pedagogy comes the possibility of rethinking the physical armature of educational spaces.

Key questions:
- Are there new tools at our disposal?
- Are there new tools that will need new spaces?
- How can the digital be synchronized with the physical?

Experiential learning represents a fundamental shift from passive knowledge absorption to active engagement. Students learn by doing, experimenting, collaborating, and reflecting rather than sitting in rows absorbing lectures. This pedagogical evolution demands architectural response.

The R&B focus examines how physical environments can support diverse learning modalities: hands-on making spaces, flexible collaboration zones, quiet reflection areas, technology-rich immersive environments, and spaces that blur indoor/outdoor boundaries. Research investigates what spatial qualities, material choices, lighting conditions, acoustic properties, and technological integrations best support different types of experiential learning activities.

This focus extends beyond K-12 into higher education, career technical education, and lifelong learning environments. By building a knowledge base around experiential learning spaces, Pfluger develops expertise that differentiates the firm in educational sector pursuits and elevates design outcomes across all education project types.

### 1.2.3 Strategic Use of AI

There are many AI tools. As an old saying goes, 'with great power comes great responsibility'. The capacity of ChatGPT 4 greatly surpasses the common knowledge of a layperson and architects, while specialized individuals can not compete with the knowledge set.

This is important to remember as while AI can do a lot, know a lot, and say a lot, we are behind the curve, and must not assume correctness. Steps and measures have been taken to isolate the level of AI creativity in the Pfluger Agents. However, the technology is not currently perfect.

Pfluger has outlined a series of AI best practices allowing us to explore these new tools without compromising our values and obligations.

AI represents a paradigm shift in architectural communication - moving beyond traditional 2D plan-based communication methods to new forms of spatial understanding and documentation.

The R&B department utilizes Claude AI as the primary computational intelligence tool with 5 dedicated research accounts (research1@pflugerarchitects.com through research5@pflugerarchitects.com). This AI infrastructure accelerates research workflows by: assisting with literature review and source synthesis, helping formulate research questions and hypotheses, analyzing survey data and identifying patterns, drafting research documentation and reports, and maintaining version control through GitHub integration.

AI usage is tracked as a key performance metric. The department measures both AI utilization rates and resulting work output to quantify time savings and productivity gains. This data-driven approach ensures AI tools deliver measurable value while maintaining quality standards. All AI-assisted work follows established best practices to ensure accuracy, proper attribution, and alignment with firm values. The goal is not to replace human expertise but to amplify researcher capacity, allowing deeper investigation and higher quality outputs within constrained time budgets.

### 1.2.4 User Experience Philosophy

Research can be a different way of thinking compared to a typical creative mindset. It involves the objective rather than the artistic subjective.

To assist in this jump, a series of templates, forms, connections, and AI tools have been curated to assist in the research journey. A common take on using tools to advance efficiency is that there is now additional leftover time to do more. It is essential to see the forest through the trees on this; these tools should be used to create time to explore further and advance, rather than do less in a bulk response.

Time and budget allotments have also been curated to respect the ongoing work and projects and balance research undertakings. With the recent abundance and progress of artificial intelligence in architecture, from image generators to Chat GPT, it is an R&B focus to steer towards these tools rather than away from them and embrace the newfound abilities to do better and take on more meaningful work.

The R&B framework provides structured support throughout the research journey. Each researcher receives a personal claude.md configuration file that captures their research focus, ongoing projects, preferred working methods, and individual context. This personalized AI configuration ensures consistent, contextually-aware assistance across research sessions.

Standardized templates guide pitch development, hypothesis formation, methodology selection, and deliverable preparation. The GreenLight Team provides active support in refining research questions, identifying partners, and navigating approval processes. Time tracking through project-specific billing codes (T01-xx series) ensures research effort is visible and valued. Touchpoint schedules appropriate to research scope (Simple/Medium/Complex) provide structure without micromanagement. This infrastructure removes administrative friction, allowing researchers to focus cognitive energy on substantive investigation rather than process navigation.

### 1.2.5 User Analytics & Continuous Improvement

Modern technology uses its users' analytics to charge advancements, directly to and indirectly to its own technology. Pfluger uses analytics in the same way to outline inefficiencies in the process and create improvement targets.

For internal AI applications, Pfluger collects bulk conversions, resource utilization, and activity to see what is used most often and how it is used. This type of feedback allows for streamlined updates and improvements to the various tools.

While this objective data can be aggregated in mass, subjective data is gathered via a survey of the tools. It is vital to complete these in any capacity to target areas for advancement accurately. Occasionally, an AI agent may reach out or collect information during a conversation about an issue it cannot assist with.

The R&B department tracks two primary metric categories: AI utilization and research output. AI utilization metrics include frequency of Claude usage per researcher, types of tasks supported by AI, time spent in AI-assisted vs. unassisted work, and GitHub commit activity showing AI-supported documentation. Research output metrics include number of research projects initiated and completed, hours invested per deliverable type, publication and presentation outcomes, and integration instances where research influenced project design decisions.

By comparing AI utilization against output metrics, the department quantifies time savings and productivity gains. This analysis informs resource allocation decisions, identifies where AI tools provide maximum value, reveals process bottlenecks requiring attention, and demonstrates ROI on AI infrastructure investment. Regular analysis cycles (quarterly) ensure the framework evolves based on measured performance rather than assumptions.

### 1.2.6 Impact & Analysis

The impact of research can range from immediate to long-term, and the impact can be proportional to the time taken to complete the research. The North Star impact of conducting research at Pfluger is to integrate 'What's Next' into our built environment via our work.

Research impact manifests across multiple timescales and domains. Immediate impact occurs when research findings directly inform active project design decisions, improving outcomes for current clients. Short-term impact appears in successful project pursuits where demonstrated research expertise differentiates Pfluger from competitors. Medium-term impact builds as published research and conference presentations establish firm thought leadership, attracting clients seeking innovation. Long-term impact accumulates as repeated research cycles build deep institutional knowledge in experiential learning environments, positioning Pfluger as the recognized expert in this domain.

Impact assessment tracks both quantitative measures (projects won, publications produced, citations received, design awards earned) and qualitative measures (client feedback, peer recognition, staff professional development). Each research project includes an impact plan identifying how findings will be applied, disseminated, and measured. This ensures research investment generates tangible returns rather than producing reports that sit unused on digital shelves.

### 1.2.7 Process Limitations & Assumptions

The intent of research at Pfluger is to enhance our work and its impact on the end user. While these effects can be translated to other sectors and areas, such as urban planning, assumptions allow research some flexibility by defining a safe and exploratory environment.

**Key Assumptions & Limitations:**

1. All Pfluger research must be GreenLit before commencing/Sponsored.

2. All employees can research intricate topics with the assistance of a Pfluger Partner.

3. If there is no active project to incorporate research into, a fictitious project can be created.

4. Research must be architecturally focused on experiential learning.

5. Research completion can not negatively influence employee standing.

6. The researcher must facilitate the coordination between the researcher and their respective project team.

7. All employees are expected to participate in research at some level with alignment to their interests.

# SECTION 2: RESEARCH PROCESS & METHODOLOGY

## 2.1 Research Process Overview

### 2.1.1 Call for Pitches Process

The research process starts with a call for pitches. With the focus of Experiential Learning, researchers are to complete the pitch form addressing a supplied idea (in a call for pitches) or address an idea they are interested in.

**Supplied Gaps**: Strategically picked in alignment with current or coming online projects and have identified research partners.

**Open Exploration**: Allows the applicant to explore a gap that may not immediately apply to a project.

For all pitches, it is up to the research applicant to derive a research idea and a research method. The GreenLight Team can assist with optional aspects such as:
- Timeline
- Funding
- Resources
- Research partners

As funding and research partnerships can be nebulous, they can be identified more in-depth during the submission process. Still, they must have an identified boundary, such as 'needed travel to a school for a survey', 'a superintendent to interview', etc.

### 2.1.2 Research Development Stages

Research work is tracked through distinct phases:

**Pre-Research (040)**: Background material gathering, literature reviews, precedent studies, or other preparatory content before formal research begins. Active during small/medium/large-scale research efforts (S/M/L).

**Schematic Research (050)**: Early development of research content - forming hypotheses, outlining structure, or initiating pilot experiments. Active during large-scale research efforts (L).

**Developmental Research (060)**: Formalizing and refining research content. Active during small/medium/large-scale research efforts (S/M/L).

**Final Research (070)**: Time spent preparing final deliverables, including polished writeups, graphics, documentation, publication-ready materials, and SharePoint page creation.

**Presentation Research (080)**: Work related to creating specific presentation materials (e.g., PowerPoint decks) for internal sharing, public events, or external partners. Active for medium and large projects.

**Research Project Integration (090)**: When research is integrated into an architectural project. Time should be billed to the project number, with a comment referencing the related RBxx code (e.g., "See X25_RB03").

## 2.2 Research Question Development

### 2.2.1 Formulating the Research Question

Formulate a specific, measurable, focused research question on an idea that frames your investigation's central issue (e.g., "How does X affect Y?"). Ensure the research question is specific, measurable, and focused. If your guiding question is vague, you may need to refine it further to make it more precise.

### 2.2.2 Identifying Variables

**Independent Variable (X)**: The variable you suspect influences the outcome.

**Dependent Variable (Y)**: This variable changes due to the influence of the independent variable.

### 2.2.3 Hypothesis Development

Present a testable prediction that outlines the expected relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: This suggests no relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It represents the default position that your research will attempt to disprove.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: This suggests a relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It represents the hypothesis you will test and potentially support.

### 2.2.4 Making the Hypothesis Testable

Ensure the hypothesis is measurable and can be evaluated using research methods like surveys, experiments, or statistical analysis.

**Measurable variable**: Time spent on social media (measured in hours per day).

**Measurable outcome**: Academic performance (measured by GPA or test scores).

### 2.2.5 Ensuring Clarity and Specificity

Clearly indicate the expected relationship, specifying conditions or thresholds if necessary (e.g., "students who spend more than 3 hours a day on social media have lower GPAs").

**Clear**: "The more time a student spends on social media, the lower their GPA will be."

**Specific**: Instead of just saying "more time," specify the threshold (e.g., "students who spend more than 3 hours a day on social media").

**Testable**: Ensure you can measure the variables in your study (e.g., measuring time on social media in hours and GPA on a numerical scale).

### 2.2.6 Implications & Literature Review

**Consider the Implications**: Consider how the results of your study could influence real-world outcomes, such as improving educational strategies or informing policy.

**Literature Review**: Conduct a literature review to understand prior findings and refine the hypothesis, ensuring it builds on existing knowledge or addresses identified gaps.

# SECTION 4: AI TOOLS & BEST PRACTICES

## 4.1 AI Best Practices

### 4.1.1 Philosophy

For Safe, Creative, and Responsible Integration of AI into Pfluger's Workflows.

The intent of the best practices is to include a safety net for the usage of AI in the architectural process without hindering its ability to assist in various aspects. A central premise is that AI should be used to create time to focus on enhancing the priority, not to create time to enhance other priorities.

The best practices will be used alongside the firm's Approved AI Tools List and Keeper credentials.

### 4.1.2 DOs

**1. Use approved AI tools**
- Reference the alternative AI tools list
- Example: You enhance a render in Krea using your firm Keeper login
- Access logins via Keeper using company-wide accounts
- If a tool isn't listed, submit a request via the Alternative AI Tools form

**2. Review all generations before finalization or presentation**
- Example: You generate a massing study concept in ChatGPT, then refine and verify it in Rhino before presenting

**3. Anonymize confidential data**
- Example: Instead of saying "Design a landscape for the Pinehurst Tech Campus," you prompt: "Design a courtyard for a 100,000 sq ft tech office in a temperate climate"

**4. Credit and disclose when AI tools are used in the majority or when mass AI assistance is obtained without partial original authorship**
- Example: On a proposal board, you include: "Visual created using AI image editing tools"

**5. Use secure accounts**
- Example: You log into Runway using the Keeper login instead of your personal email

**6. Consult IT or legal for edge cases**
- Example: You want to test a new platform for 3D-to-video generation. Before uploading, you ask your BIM lead and IT team for approval

### 4.1.3 DON'Ts

**1. Avoid using personal or personal paid accounts for Pfluger work. Only use your Pfluger email tied to a Pfluger account**
- Example: You use your personal paid Chat GPT account to help write a narrative and accidentally share personal conversations or vice versa

**2. Don't upload proprietary designs, models, or internal documents without approval**
- Example: You drop a full Revit model into a free AI object recognition site to "speed up tagging." That model now lives on their servers

**3. Don't rely on AI for legal, contractual, or safety-critical content**
- Example: You ask an AI to draft zoning language for a public submission and submit it without review—it contains errors that put the project at risk

**4. Don't misrepresent AI outputs as fully human-generated**
- Example: You present a fully AI-generated concept render as your own original without mentioning AI use. This misleads stakeholders and opens to authorship liability and copyright

**5. Don't train or fine-tune AI using internal firm data**
- Example: You try to improve an AI model by feeding it real site photos and drawings from confidential projects—these could be leaked or misused

### 4.1.4 Avoid Altogether

**1. Using unvetted or unknown AI tools**
- Example: You find a "free AI render fixer" online and upload a concept, only to realize it shares everything you upload with third parties

**2. Sharing client names, locations, specs, or visuals externally**
- Example: You post an AI-enhanced video of a design still under NDA on your personal social media to show off your work

**3. Bypassing design review**
- Example: You let a text-to-video tool generate a walkthrough, skip team review, and send it to the client—it includes inaccurate semantics

# SECTION 5: RESEARCH PARTNERS

## 5.1 Partnership Philosophy

Pfluger partnerships work top down. Pfluger realizes that research is not a native focus of architecture and may require outside expertise to complete adequately. Research Partners fill that gap and can provide insight, support, and resources.

During the submission process, research partners are asked to be documented. If there are no known ones, the approval team will curate one applicable to the research scope and intensity.

## 5.2 Research Partners & Resources alex wickes needs to update the csv

**Master Resource File**: `/Shared/Shared Resources/RESEARCH AND BENCHMARKING/02_Research and Benchmarking Resources/02_Resources/RB Research Partners and Resources.csv`

The CSV database contains curated research partners and resources organized by category. When identifying research partners during pitch development or research execution, consult this database for appropriate contacts and resources.

**Database Categories:**
- Insight Websites - Industry research and thought leadership sources
- Academic Journals - Peer-reviewed publication sources
- Specialists - Expert consultants and certification bodies

**Usage**: When completing pitch form Question 4 ("Who are the Pfluger Partners, and what sources support your pitch?"), reference this CSV database to identify appropriate research resources and potential partners. The CSV is the single source of truth for all research partners and resources.

## 5.3 Internal Partners

Internal partners are senior staff with expertise in an area of focus, specialty consultants, or specific vendors with a research focus.

**Types of Internal Partners:**
- Senior architects with specialized expertise (educational design, sustainability, etc.)
- In-house technical specialists (BIM, computational design, building science)
- Preferred consultants with research capabilities (MEP, structural, etc.)
- Vendor partners with R&D focus (material suppliers, systems manufacturers)

Internal partners typically provide guidance, review research methodology, connect to external resources, and validate findings against practical application. No additional funding typically required.

## 5.4 External Partners

External Partners may require funding. Depending on the involvement of an external partner, this may introduce the reliance on grants or larger funding approval.

**Types of External Partners:**
- Academic institutions and university research centers
- Independent research organizations
- Industry associations and professional bodies
- Publishing and editorial services
- Specialized consultants outside normal project scope

**Funding Considerations:**
- Determine if partner requires compensation or operates on collaboration basis
- Identify potential grant opportunities if significant funding needed
- Obtain funding approval through GreenLight Team during pitch review
- Structure agreements (NDAs, data sharing, publication rights) before work begins

### X25-RB11: Turf Melting Mitigation Study (Let's Focus)
**Status**: Research in progress - Tony S and Casey M notified of options
**Shareout Potential**: Internal Able, External no
**Project**: Denton ISD Martinez Elementary School (Project 22-024)
**Research Type**: Quick Research Sprint - Experimental Design (20 hours)
**Latest Update** (November 2025): Tony S and Casey M were notified of options on the table for turf melting mitigation strategies.
**Research Premise**: Investigates solar reflections from south-facing courtyard glazing that pose risk of melting artificial turf. Anti-reflective film (Turf Guard Clear) has been specified to reduce reflections from 12% to approximately 4%. Study quantifies baseline irradiance levels, demonstrates reduction achieved with film, and proposes additional shading strategies if needed.
**Project Context**:
- Location: Denton ISD Martinez Elementary (formerly Spiritas Ranch / Eppright Drive), Denton, TX
- Issue: South-facing curved courtyard glazing (CW7) creates concentrated reflections onto artificial turf surface
- Solution Implemented: ASI 038R2 (01/13/2025) - Turf Guard Clear perforated window film specified
- Glazing: Solarban 90 (2) Clear + Clear, Low-E Glass (baseline 12% reflectance)
**Research Objectives**:
1. Baseline Analysis: Simulate irradiance levels with existing glazing (no film, 12% reflectance)
2. Film Performance: Simulate irradiance reduction with film (4% reflectance)
3. Mitigation Options: Propose and simulate three shading strategies:
   - Option A: Freestanding shading elements
   - Option B: Building-mounted shading above glazing
   - Option C: Shading on glazing mullions
4. Threshold Compliance: Determine if solutions keep irradiance below turf melting threshold (160°F / 71°C damage threshold)
**Analysis Tools**: Ladybug/Honeybee (Rhino + Grasshopper) for irradiance simulations
**Success Criteria**: Reflected irradiance reduced to levels preventing surface temperatures exceeding 160°F (71°C). Film demonstrates measurable reduction in reflected irradiance. At least one shading option achieves full compliance if film alone insufficient.
**Background Research Completed**:
- Turf melting temperature: 175-200°F (79-93°C) for polyethylene-based synthetic turf
- Thermal distortion begins: 160°F (71°C)
- Concentrated Low-E glass reflections can create: 200-300°F surface temperatures
- Normal sunny conditions (~1000 W/m²): Artificial turf reaches 162°F
**Resources & Partners**: Project team coordination (Tony S, Casey M), Turf Guard manufacturer data
**Identified future project alignment**: Martinez Elementary courtyard design (active construction issue resolution)

# SECTION 7: RESEARCH REPOSITORY & INTEGRATION

## 7.1 Repository Systems Overview

The R&B department employs a dual-system architecture for research storage and version control. Egnyte serves as the authoritative file server where all research materials must reside per company policy. GitHub provides version control and change tracking. This structure ensures compliance with firm data management requirements while enabling robust collaboration and versioning capabilities.

All research files exist in Egnyte with corresponding GitHub repositories tracking changes. Custom web application provides public-facing access to published research. Additional systems (SharePoint, Vantage Point, Open Asset) serve specific integration functions connecting research to other firm workflows.

The root level R&B Knowlege base markdown files contains all working knowlege of RB as well as high level overviews of active work. this document is to be updated by weekly.

### 7.1.1 Egnyte (Primary Storage)

**Purpose**: Authoritative storage for all R&B research files per company data management policy

**Location**: `/Shared/Shared Resources/RESEARCH AND BENCHMARKING/`

**Structure**:
- Each research project (X25-RB01, X25-RB02, etc.) has dedicated folder
- Personal researcher workspaces contain individual claude.md configurations
- Shared resources include templates, frameworks, and reference materials
- Published research archive maintains completed work

**Access**: Standard Pfluger Egnyte permissions apply. R&B team members have read/write access to active projects, read-only access to archive.

**Workflow**: All file creation, editing, and storage occurs in Egnyte. Files are never stored exclusively in GitHub or local machines. Egnyte is the single source of truth.

### 7.1.2 GitHub (Version Control)

**Purpose**: Version control, change tracking, and collaboration for research development

**Structure**: Each Egnyte R&B project folder has corresponding GitHub repository

**Account Management**:
- **Current**: All repositories managed through alex.wickes@pflugerarchitects.com
- **Future**: Migration to dedicated R&B organizational account

**Repository Naming Convention**: `RB-[Project Code]-[Project Name]`
- Example: `RB-X25-RB01-Sanctuary-Spaces`

**Workflow**:
1. Researcher works on files in Egnyte folder
2. Changes committed to corresponding GitHub repo with descriptive commit messages
3. Git tracks complete history of research development
4. GitHub serves as backup and enables collaborative review

**Commit Standards**:
- Clear, descriptive commit messages documenting what changed and why
- Regular commits (not massive batches) to maintain granular history
- Tag major milestones (pitch approval, deliverable completion, publication)

**Branch Strategy**:
- `main` branch = current approved research state
- Feature branches for experimental directions or major revisions
- Pull requests for collaborative review before merging significant changes

### 7.1.3 Custom Research Web Application (Ezra)

**STATUS: UNDER DEVELOPMENT - PARTIALLY CONCEPTUAL**

**Note**: The custom R&B web application (codename: Ezra) is currently under active development. Some features described below are conceptual and subject to change during development.
