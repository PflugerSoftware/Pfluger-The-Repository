## Launch Date & Software Setup

**AW:** OK. RB RB. Yeah. I don't have anything to share here, just have meeting notes. So yeah, I read your notes the other night. So OK, sweet. So I guess first one is for setting this date for launching. So I was proposing the end of January.

**CO:** Yep, right on. OK, so. Because yesterday, as you saw, we're trying to fine tune our budget. That needs to be board approved. I think it's going to the board on mid January. So last day of the month, somewhere around there is fine to launch this because we'll already have vetted out dollars and cents, right?

**AW:** OK, so but in order for me to finish building all this stuff, I gotta have the tools in order to do it. So those tools you went over yesterday. Yes. And the ones that I emailed Craig and Austin with, I see you on that one. So those we technically already have the budget for because we've already bought them and the other ones are just free, so there's really no expense to incur on them, right? So if he can just get those accounts set up, I can start working 'cause right now I'm just like completely flying blind. Yes, I am so far out of the loop on all these conversations, there's like really no way for me to know like who's doing what? Who to talk to? Who is pulling the strings? Who has the permission to do what? So I don't know who the... I get it. Craig is doing all the IT stuff.

**CO:** That's a consultant. But yeah, so any IT staff has to go through him. Those are all those tools, all those accounts and whatnot. Yeah. So I mean, he's sending that e-mail. Has he responded?

**AW:** No. So, but it's like I can't wait until like the last week and start working because it's like right now I'm already way behind schedule because I was like trying to do this in December and November and I was told to stop. So it's like I can't... I don't know. So I don't know if we want to do January and then like, is the board going to approve this stuff or is it going to be like they're only approving a dollar amount?

**CO:** OK, so they're not going to come out of it and be like, we don't have time to go through the nuances of that. We need to talk about it some more. Because then it's February, March and then you might as well just do... Yeah. So I mean, if it's just software and it's not implications of cost, you should have that loaded already. So tell Craig and Austin to load it.

**AW:** OK.

**CO:** Give you the rights. I mean, Lauren's not going to know. And she's expecting you to help drive that already. So that's the thing - is there anybody sitting around? Craig's loaded up. OK, right. Yeah. So I guess that goes, especially if it's programs that don't cost anything or it's already in the budget. We could go ahead and start activating it going through that. OK, yeah. So just follow up with him and be like, talked with Christian this morning, start getting going on the stuff. Good. Yeah, I mean, especially if there's no dollar implications.

**AW:** What I gained from that is pretty much anything over $2000 is a spend and anything under that is nothing. So all of this stuff, I mean, it's like 100 bucks a year. So is that considered a cost that has to be approved by the board or is that something that can be done before that?

**CO:** The Excel that we went through yesterday was to get us to a dollar amount. Right. And then that dollar amount is then going into a bigger dollar amount that is then going to the board. And so if it's a nuance of $100 or whatever that's baked in that, I think it's fine. I guess what I need to hear from you is what are we buying and what are we not? What do you still need approval from? What do you not that we didn't do yesterday?

**AW:** Nothing. I went over all the items, so all the items I went over - some of those items were new. Yeah, like a mix. Was it relatable to a big dollar amount? Less than that, like $2000 a year? So the other one for that is like if it's not a cost occurred at once, that's over 12 months. So to get it started I think you're looking at like 20 bucks. So for me it's kinda like, is that what's the holdup? But then it's like, I don't have any agency to say to do that, you know, because I'm in a position where I'm just like kind of helping and advising. So it's like I can't go to Craig and say, hey, I need to get the software installed. Because then he's got to like get his stuff approved and everything. So I don't... I'm just not sure of like where... who... I guess that's why I'm talking to you about this because it's like you're on the board. So it's like who can we go? I guess can we do this? Can we get it installed or is it? Is it I have to get it approved by somebody else just so it doesn't create like a situation, you know where it's like Alex is starting to install stuff. Like why does he need to install stuff? Like we have this process.

**CO:** Send an e-mail to Craig and Lauren and copy me. OK, don't overthink it. Yeah, 'cause it's like less than 2000 a year, like stupid. And to start it up, you're looking at like 100 bucks. Yeah. So OK, so just, yeah, get the low hanging items.

## Content Approval & Marketing Pipeline

**AW:** OK, sweet. And then so for this one, for the internal launch and the external launch, there's like the content approval process and I know for all of the research that we did last year. We've only put out the one from Catherine and Brayden, but there's all the other stuff. So what is the process then to get the stuff approved to market? Is that just you and Cody or externally? Externally and internally.

**CO:** So I think right now for us, well, what do you have that needs to be externally communicated? Let's start there. Anything.

**AW:** So it's our immersive learning, the mass timber, then our dashboards...

**CO:** So dashboards I would not publicize. I mean, you're going to be doing that with clients, right? Yeah. Is that what you're thinking? You're not saying let's go to design and construction and start to publicize our...

**AW:** No, no, no.

**CO:** So let me bring this out. To answer your question, it would be a partnership with Cody. We are in the process of hiring another marketing director. So once that person's on board and they can help us navigate. But I would say we're at the beginnings of some new research projects. So at the point they're ready to market. That's not really my main focus of R&B. R&B is to quickly get it fed into the projects and then show those outcomes. So I think we got a little time. Brain's and Catherine's was a little different. It was flipping it, right? It was an idea. So depending on what we get in the applications, we can measure that. I'm always hesitant of taking anything publicly without showing or demonstrating outcomes.

**AW:** So I think we got a little time. So I guess from that then is the no-go point - is it on the project? Because if we're waiting for the research to be on a project, realistically we could be waiting three years to pick up the ideas. So do we want to revise that to be more loose? In terms of a research project, yeah, 'cause you end at different levels, right? Well, so for instance, so like, here's all these, right? So you have modulizer Part 2. So this one is the energy analysis for Flour Bluff, right? If we're gonna wait until this is built to publish it, you're gonna have to wait either until the project goes through, doesn't die, or finally gets built and is occupied with final photos. So you, I mean, really, you'll wait three years. And so then you'd have a whole backlog of like 80 things. Everything's waiting to go. And just on like a point to get people involved in this, you could say like, "Oh yeah, you're gonna work on this, but probably you won't be able to talk about it," you know? So it's like maybe there's a looser area to talk about things, to publish things because it's like this is still such exciting stuff, you know, because you want to show your client. You want to have this out there saying like, no, we're doing energy analysis on these buildings. We're doing lighting analysis on these buildings. We're investigating mass timber. Yeah. So I think there's like still ways to talk about this stuff without it being built.

---

## R&B Purpose & Philosophy

**CO:** Let me help you. This is the conversation I had with Heather. So Heather's all about publishing. The whole purpose of R&B is to enhance. Now, what do we mean by enhance? Ultimately the work. Secondary is expertise.

Right, so work first. Whatever we're researching should enhance the work day one. I don't care about other things, but whatever that research component is should ultimately start to feed as best and as quickly as possible - work broadly or a specific project or how we work process-wise. AI, right? We're barely tapping into that as it relates to Logan, but what about specs? What about QA/QC? Whatever, right? That's an R&B effort, but it ultimately makes the project better for our clients and then through that effort, you're growing expertise.

Way down here is the publication of that. That's not the whole premise of that. That's an outcome of making our work better. So as it relates to that effort, that little seed on that one project that was created - that analysis should now start to spread to our projects.

And so I'm less concerned about publishing something that we haven't brought consistency to, right? Because you don't hear much about sustainability or energy modeling or stuff like that in any of our offices.

So the point of that one project should be now to spill into Flower Bluff like we talked about and then open X. Now Corpus is learning what that is. So next time Corpus is working on a project, it starts to be a habit. So it's going up one-off in the work and then it's to create habits. And then ultimately if in some of this opportunity we get an opportunity to share out - like I don't, we'll have to pick and choose. Is there opportunity to share our story? What are we doing different?

Right. That was the Katherine and Braden. But I told Katherine quickly get this in because right now it's this discussion in the cloud. That doesn't really make you an expert based on what makes you an expert is how you take this and enact on it, right. So I only say that first - so publications and all that should be the last thing we're thinking about.

Because R&B is still somewhat new to this firm. We're growing the muscles ultimately to make our work better. Second is to create experts and then third is to show that out, right? Some of these instances you can do this through, like I said, the work.

But I think that should help in terms of your when you're looking at these applications, how can we prioritize the effort which will also help prioritize our staff, all those other things we got to figure out right the labor, but the way to make this work is to research through the work as best as we can and then all this other stuff just happens, right? I think for me with the Texas Architect is to start to create that relationship and we don't have Sun West. Maybe we'll get them back, but creating that conduit, I published stuff with them before without even having marketing.

---

## Internal vs External Content (The Repo)

**AW:** Can I go back to this?

**CO:** Yes.

**AW:** So we have this thing, this concept called The Repo, right? This is where all of the work and the expertise shares up. So this - you can think of this the repo or the depo. This is like a big container, right. And we divide the container in half. And part of our work lives in both. So we have our external and then our internal, right? What I need to know is where is this line? Because if it's all internal, that's perfectly fine because that still works. So someone can, you know, get on here and they can go, oh, look at all this fun stuff, you know, they can say, oh, analysis. So I have my different options and everything.

**CO:** It's hard to answer it. I think it's going to be a case by case. So do we want to start with everything on the internal side? Yes. And so it's in knowing - we will right size the push, right. But the main focus day one is this and then we're going to seek those opportunities. Depending on what it is - like for that example, Kennedy, we're just trying to get in the habit of talking about energy modeling and what's that tool and at some point we're the sustainability guys because right now we're not even talking about it, right. For that instance, now it's the reverse for Katherine and Braden. Now it's to quickly get to that. So then they can come back to an external presentation in two years to say, let's start that conversation again and here's some work.

**AW:** Yeah. OK. So we're gonna start all on the internal side and then we will decide what comes over here to external. And then these blocks can either shift to be equal on internal and external or maybe like the dashboard is all internal and there's no external.

**CO:** Yeah, correct. Because that's going to be our baby, right? So that's something you're not going to want to share to the world other than put in your clients because we want to be the keeper of that. What was the other example? So mass timber. We're not going to be able to publish anything as it relates to the Mass Timber Book as we don't have anything. You could still demonstrate the thought leadership. Yeah, but I think in terms of the competition, there's plenty of big boys that have stuff to show that have built. So that's not anything new. It's great to show and talk about knowledge, but when we don't have any substance. You've heard the term greenwashing, right? When LEED first came out, there was a lot of greenwashing. I feel like it's a little bit of that. We are trying to understand mass timber as it relates to helping push projects. That's what the beauty about the nugget. We got the gym that landed in our lap, right? So holy cow, we got a contractor pushing it, so we're going to ride that wave. So when we do get that gym, hopefully we can then start to pull externally.

**AW:** Because I just wouldn't want this to end up in a situation where we're afraid to talk about things.

**CO:** No, no, no, for sure. And so go back to immersive learning. Now there are other firms that have a lot more capability than we do. So I think we have enough thought now it's to be able to get a couple of examples. So then we could do presentations.

---

## Research Integration into Projects

**AW:** So another one I want to talk about this one is who then is responsible for taking the research and implementing it into the beginnings of the projects? Because if that is a broken link, this... I mean like, unless they're your application process, right? Well, so this is like the immersive learning, right? Like we have a huge chunk. I mean, I have 120 slides on this. Yeah. And an example of this was like Allie. So this morning she asked for, I think it's like Taylor. We're doing an interview and she said, oh, I'd like the slides for immersive learning.

**CO:** Yeah, I asked her to get with you.

**AW:** Yeah. So to take it into this now, but that relies on either you saying to the principal or project manager who's talking to the client like these are the things you need to bring up, but if we're relying on that link as the only instance that this can be in the external side... When you say external, is that are you talking about client? Well, yeah, to get it. I mean, in order for it to get on a project, you have to talk about it. Or like mass timber, right? Like if we're gonna do a new mass timber school that has to be started from day one. And if that conversation doesn't exist, I can do all of the research in the world. But if there's no method to put it into the beginning of a contract, right?

**CO:** Yeah. So I think what will help is the application. So the project manager should be a part of that team to ensure that that's going to happen or not, right? So they are the keeper with the team on the budget. To your point on, we're not going to have overtime. Just to be honest, we can't. Now it's going to come out of the project somehow, some way. And that might mean a little extra effort or not, but that's why we're aligning passions with drive through a project.

**AW:** And so like thinking for that is more or less like who is integrating the research then into the project. Whoever that team is. So that really relies on the principal, whoever is talking with the client at the very beginning day one. Because it can't be like Neilan going to Will and say, hey, let's do immersive learning on this project.

**CO:** I think in your application we're trying to run those traps, right? So if Neilan's got an idea, he should go to his people leader that we like getting that all baked in in the application process. So there's awareness, it's not just people looking for stuff outside of their job to do, which will then anchor it to the work, right? So if I have an idea around mass timber, if I'm William Webb as a senior PA and he's trying to look for opportunities. I think it would be inherent on his part to get with his managing principal to say let's look for opportunities together because you're client facing. So I was hopeful that in the application process that starts to get baked in and as a panel we should ask those questions.

**AW:** Right.

**CO:** To say, OK, that's interesting, but that's either going to be outside of the work or right. And have you talked? So just so you know, labor planning is not on managing principals anymore. They are not the keeper of the hours or the people or the time. So that should help in this effort a little bit, but I'm hopeful that whatever it is now we're going to have to make some decisions as it relates to dollars and investment for the firm, but that should take all within that application and panel process.

---

## Hours & Utilization Discussion

**AW:** OK, so on those - who is the keeper of those? Keeper of what? Project hours? Project labor?

**CO:** The directors. So those are per project.

**AW:** So I guess an example of this one is... I mean, like historically the project hours always take preference, right? Like if you have to get something done, you're doing the drawings 100%, right? Even though, like even last year, I had the message with Eric on Flower Bluff. Dude, I broke it down. He's put it on Vantage Point everything and his response was can you try to reduce it by 33%? So it's like if that is not even hours on the project, who then I guess like has my back saying like no, you're gonna be deferring this on your project time, like your project's gonna have these hours...

**CO:** So all positions have a utilization rate and they're not all 100%.

**AW:** So there's 85.

**CO:** Yeah. So if some positions, I mean, it's just a flux, right? And you're getting down with the science, exact science of it, it's... Let me tell you this. I've been with a firm for 30 years and we had this making like a well-oiled Corvette machine and we did not pay overtime. Our utilization rates were higher and we still got a lot of shit done. So I think it's a cultural shift that we need to get ahead of to start to set an expectation. But it's also filtered through the application process. I don't think it needs to be everybody's ideas all. I mean, I'm hopeful we get 200, but I doubt it. And then it's a realignment of effort and so I will have that message.

You've now been put in a position of having that message and the directors, which is Ali, Josh, Tony Schmitz, Tony Plascencia and Chad Martin, are going to help navigate that conversation too, as it relates to people's hours, effort, all that stuff.

Now the project team will obviously be a part of that, but if you got a project team member that has put in the application these individuals. I mean, that's the hope, right, is that we handle all that discussion in the application process. So it's not a "oh, I'm surprising Eric with an idea." Now Eric just got in the middle of a firefight because projects were already kicked off. I mean, I guess I would ask you, how do you see this happening?

**AW:** To be honest, this is gonna be super difficult.

**CO:** So that's for you to help manage too.

---

## Overtime Math (Research Hours Policy)

**AW:** So I did the math on it. So this is I guess then this one is just so you're aware of the numbers. With how the overtime was working last year - the first four hours are unpaid, right? Then anything after that is paid. If you are working on the clock, you're still getting paid, but if you're doing the R&B and billing to the vantage point project number for R&B, you're not billing to the project, so you're losing revenue. So the revenue lost at 2000 hours is $255,000. On the clock overtime is overhead of $50,000. So that comes down to it's like the more research you do, the more revenue you're going to lose versus if it's spending 1/5 the cost if it's on overtime.

**CO:** Yeah, we're cool with that. Yeah, because then it's like you're still gonna battle all of the whole - people want to work 40 hours a week. That's on them. It's not gonna help us as a firm, to be honest. But I get that that's 90-98% of the firm.

As of today, for the last five years, only five people have worked overtime. So this overtime conversation, no one's working it. I mean, you and Logan did for that one Midlothian effort. The rest of us are in the positions we're at. We're working 70 hours a week. I'm not getting paid for it, to be honest. I don't care. I'm trying to drive a firm, so it really will be passion-aligned. With a team that cares about getting stuff done. So for Katherine and Braden, they're figuring it out, right? We're trying to onboard Eric, right? That was again. He was already kind of halfway in, but I think through the application process we can ask these questions. I think we'll have to fine tune the effort. We'll see, but. I mean, we're just trying to put as much framework as we can for this, but no, it's going to be through a project or whatever it comes in the application process.

---

## Vantage Point Coding

**AW:** So are we billing the research hours to the project or are we continuing with the Vantage Point?

**CO:** I think the coding as we did it last was what I told Lisa we were gonna do. We need to follow up with her because that might have been forgotten. So the R&B vantage point project numbers, I think we still keep those.

And as it relates to needing to tie into a project, I know she's now rolling out getting coding.

**AW:** Yes, because I saw that e-mail come through and it's like, where's now? Now where is this being categorized as? And for me in my position, I don't have any control of that. So it's then that goes back with the whole conversation where it's like I'm...

**CO:** So let's not talk about control. Let's get ahead of it with Lisa, OK, to understand - hey, we're not dislodging this effort. We're going to keep rolling with R&B and a lot of it should be through the project work. We're gonna align it as much and as best as possible through the project work. And so let's just see how she wants to help identify it, right? So the control is in your hands. Let's get that wording out of your head. You're helping lead this effort. And so it's for you to come with solutions to say, Lisa, I still need this, right? Because I think we still want to track the effort. Now how best we do that? Here's how we framed it as of a week ago. And but let her know, yeah, we're gonna tie as much of it through the work as we can.

**AW:** OK, so I'll need to coordinate with Lisa then to structure the... I'd do it today.

**CO:** Because I sat with her briefly while we were talking about other stuff and I said, you know, we're still cruising with R&B. Yeah, her analogy is that if it's through the project work, we're paying people salary regardless. And then for us, it's just being able to track the effort. She didn't get a sense that she needed to do anything different.

**AW:** Well, I can't create project numbers, correct.

**CO:** So it'll be anchored to a project, but then it'll be a subset. I think it's how we framed it, right?

**AW:** No, these are entirely different project numbers. It's not a sub number of a project. We put it to show the integration. It's its own project number and one of the sub numbers is project integration. And through the research you're researching on the project. So because if it's on a sub number - because if every piece of research has to be a sub number of a project, you can't do something that isn't on a project.

**CO:** So it has this year. That's what we have to do based on everything else, I guess. I guess ask her, let's see. And again, all this is going to be flushed out through the application process because I don't know. Yeah, because that way you don't have to wait for a project to exist in order to submit an idea. But I would hope that the idea quickly gets to the project.

---

## R&B vs Best Practices

**CO:** Now the difference is like for Monse's. Is that research or is that best practices right? Does that need to be? Is that really an R&B effort or is that just how we should be doing our best practice as it relates to materials? Unless there's something I'm missing in her effort, but. Yeah, I think we just meet with her and go through it. OK. And and again, it's hard to answer without knowing what the ideas are gonna be.

**AW:** You know, it's just if they're not their own isolated things, you're gonna just, you'll greatly reduce the number of opportunities that you can explore. Because it's like, I mean like mass timber - looking at starting mass timber. There wasn't a project for it and if you had to have to like pull strings to search for something to quickly align it to.

**CO:** So that's a perfect example of best practice as a firm that does architecture. I would say that's not so much R&B, it is as you framed it, but I gave that to you as it relates to we need to be on level with our competition, so that's kind of a bridge of R&B, but not so much.

**AW:** The external side is the market differentiation, correct. And then your internal is just your internal thought leadership. Yeah. So it's like you can push that. But if you have to push it in lining with a project, a work that's been secured, then it creates a situation where it's like I really want to explore this, but I can't because we're not already looking at it. It's like a chicken before the egg type of deal.

**CO:** Yeah, some of this is R&B and some of it's not. I mean, I would think like just opening it up to where it is part of it and then you see where that idea goes. And I was like the whole like with the pitch thing to make sure you're not like just, you know, looking at Ant farms, you know. But if you're looking at Ant farms and it's a new sustainable brick material that you can use on a facade and it's fireproof. Then it's like, OK, well then that's aligned to it. But then if you have to say like, oh, we need an elementary school to use this on...

---

## Hours Bucket & Application Process

**AW:** How did we define on your repo what validates an R&B effort? Then we went through that kind of rough concept of an idea to help frame people's efforts. So if it fell into the different categories and the different scopes, the different three levels, right? As far as like what the content or what you're centering on, instead of coming up with predefined ideas, you leave it completely wide open. And that way you get ideas that are like inside of the architecture box or outside of it. And the outside ones is the market differentiation where the inside the box ones is like stuff you're already doing and it's like why are we looking at wall paints, you know, so it's leaving it open and not defining it allows the person to bring their creativity into it, which gives them motivation to look at it. So that was the whole intent of that. And then through the pitch process you define like which is this something worth looking at? Like if someone's like back to like an Ant farm, right? Or like fungus, right? Like, I really want to look at mushrooms and you're like, why are you doing that? But then it's like the whole pitch process is to then help them steer the idea towards something.

**CO:** No, for sure. So it's like, oh, I want to look at, you know, like the fungus brick blocks for facades. And you're like, OK, that's cool. But see that to me, you can talk about externally even though it's not on a project. Yeah, I mean, that's the gauge is like we're talking conceptuals. I mean, it's really hard to, I mean, once we get in the applications to know where all this goes, I would say as quickly as we can like mass timber. When I had you do that, we quickly tried to get it enacted into the projects. So let's do this in your hours. We burned 765 hours compared to what was planned was 2000.

So would we roughly say going into this year we want to bucket 1000 hours worth of effort towards R&B? Now we're hoping to have a lot of those hours overlap in the project work, right? Just like the Safara effort with Augustine that correlated quickly to his work on the project as a senior PA. We'll try to, as a panel, help navigate that conversation.

And then it's an investment discussion being on if it's an idea that is different, that might not necessarily have a project, as you're saying, identified yet, but it's a great idea. I hadn't thought about that. How does that differentiate Pfluger in the course of learning?

**AW:** Does that help? So for the 726 verse 2000, mine was a chunk of that was for the dashboard and this cost estimating tool.

**CO:** Which is that your effort. Yeah, so take that out. OK. Actually, so take like Monse's and Augustini. So I would say what would be dangerous about that was there was no open pitch process exactly and the fact that two of them technically got burned.

**AW:** Which ones?

**CO:** So it was the whole, all of the Flower Bluff. That one pretty much got shot in half. And then and some of that we're going to have all the mess, but I hope again through this application process that you've had a discussion as a project team. If it's related to a project, right. And a lot of those we've kind of taken out. So anyway, yes, Scott burn, we're trying to build a process moving forward that will help that.

**AW:** So if we decrease from 2000 to 1000 though...

**CO:** I'm just throwing a number out. I would say if the conversation's already at 2000, I'm framing all this around 2000, I would just say stay at 2000.

**AW:** So 2000 turns out to 10 R&B projects at 200 hours each. And that's gracious enough for all the other ones. So like, I think Augustine's was like 170.

**CO:** 140, yeah, we can. That's so 2000, that's just a big bucket. And then I guess we'll just go through the application process and that aligns to these as whatever comes up, right. Or the benefit or if it's even an R&B effort. Right. Some of these aren't. Some of them are like so far. I'm like, yeah, that's not really an R&B effort, but based on where we're at as a firm, every firm's doing that.

OK, let's get with Lisa. And let's walk through what we did for R&B last year. Let's pick up our conversation that I had with her briefly about trying to pull it into the work. So some of those hours we're hoping as we steer this should be through the project work, but some of it's not. Anyway, let's just have a bucket. So let's just get with her. Yeah.

---

## R&B Expense Budget

**AW:** So then another budget question is then for R&B expense. So for last year we didn't have an expense. An example of this one is Katherine - she wants to branch out hers to do post-occupancy studies on the Denton projects.

**CO:** Yeah, and that's actually something I have. I gave to Brenda to lead before Katherine was even here, so maybe they're collaborating on it, I think. I don't think that's an R&B effort. We've talked about post occupancy surveys for five years.

**AW:** So if it's not, then what project does that go to? Cause for me that's a complete continuation of their phase one. And to be able to study that without having to be like restricted to what the project is, have an outcome, being able to fail on it.

**CO:** Yeah. So I've actually put that in Brenda's goals, OK. So we can work that through Brenda's salary. So she's anchored a little bit to the projects. But she's broader. She's like you, right? She helps the firm. And so maybe we work that through Brenda, through Katherine. It's a best practices. I don't think that's an R&B effort.

**AW:** So they put that time to... That's a coding thing with Lisa.

**CO:** OK, as you can tell, I'm not so concerned, but I know people are. But I'm like, if we're to be competitive with other firms, these are just things we need to be doing.

**AW:** Yeah. And you don't want to use the R&B platform to not do post occupancy.

**CO:** I think it's a good effort that Catherine is doing. So that's not an R&B effort in my mind.

**AW:** So to take that to like an R&B scope, like how I would see it would be if you could put like heart monitors on all the kids. And then you have them like different or you were able to like, you know, observe like where they go, where they congregate and everything because like that is a significant effort to do. And it's like you can't just, I mean you can, but then you don't, you're not able to like evaluate it, run analysis on it. Do heat maps of the floor plans. You're showing this school is rotated this way. This one's getting sunlight here. Is there a correlation between student activity and focusing it as like a research example?

**CO:** I know at Corgan that they did that for all of health science. Hospitals did that in my past life. And so it's like those - they frame that as research. Yeah, I know. And it's like that would be an awesome publication to have, you know, or even just awareness internally, you know.

---

## Leadership & Chain of Command

**AW:** And then just to confirm on this internal side of the chain of command. So just so I'm aware. Am I helping to lead it?

**CO:** You're leading it.

**AW:** Am I leading it?

**CO:** You are leading it.

**AW:** Am I also directing it?

**CO:** Yes. OK, so that's a part of your announcement.

**AW:** OK, so for that then, who do I need to talk to to get people's hours approved - not hours approved, hours diverted? Is that the people leader or is like, how is it going up and then down? You know, because someone's gonna submit a form, right? We're gonna talk about it, but we have to make sure that it's aligned to whatever...

**CO:** I think it's for us to... depending on what the idea is and if it's anchored to a project, that might be a series of questions we're asking. Have you gotten with your people leader on this, right? Because they need to be aware of what their people are doing anyway. But then we can specifically ask if there's not somebody already a PM on that. They should be a part of your effort to help navigate the conversation.

My thought is that we do that in the application process and then what you and I can do is to get with the directors next week as it relates to - OK, we're gonna push this out at the end of January. Just know we're going to need your help as it relates to staffing and some people are might be totally interested in trying to do this through their work, so just be conscious of that when we're talking to each office.

So I think it'll be a lot of us with you leading that to make sure it's happening. So in that conversation of the application process, we will get that all out.

---

## Application Panel

**AW:** So the question for you is did we set it up to where we're getting these applications all throughout the year or are we honing in on March 1st, bring your ideas and we are as a panel gonna look at all these ideas and then select the ones that make sense for this year based on the effort and time. What do you think?

**CO:** So I would ask then is who is "we" as a firm?

**AW:** What do you mean? Like who would be deciding that?

**CO:** That would be you and I. And let's start there and Brenda and Josh as it relates to the ideas.

**AW:** As it relates to the work, who else?

**CO:** Keep the panel as small as possible. That's why I think those four OK. And then in my... I can then take those to the exec team. We meet weekly. So depending on when we get these in, I think that's the next step is why don't we through your process, let's do a presentation to the exec team. Cool before we roll it out.

**AW:** Yeah, that's pretty fast.

**CO:** It's pretty fast. Then because I wouldn't want Ben for that to be... You just have so many more hands in the cookie jar, which I completely get.

**AW:** I understand. Yeah, that would just be presentation. We wouldn't ask input.

**CO:** I really like the font to be on the left side. OK.

---

## AI Integration for Pitch Process

**AW:** So the other style for this is to with integrating AI into it, it can kind of almost function as its own self-running entity. Where instead of interfacing with the person with themselves or us to help develop their pitch, they interface with the AI which knows the pitch process.

**CO:** Perfect.

**AW:** And so they are integrating with it and then once they're complete, they hit complete and it checks it and then it goes, there we go. And then it goes to a bigger list.

**CO:** You're the spearhead. OK, you're the leader. OK. Welcome to leadership. Been there, done that.

---

## The Repo Demo

**AW:** So for right now, you're just leaving this as a standalone for right now. Yeah, it doesn't have to be linked. It's its own domain. So how I've been doing all the other ones is it's just like the name.pflugerarchitects.com. So it's like vision is vision.pflugerarchitects.com. This one is just like the repo.pflugerarchitects.

**CO:** What is the repo meaning - like repository? OK, it'll stick. Don't worry, it'll stick.

**AW:** I'll let it simmer.

**CO:** I'll let it simmer. The repo man is gonna take your car away.

**AW:** Yeah, take it all. So for the internal side is pretty much like until there's like, you know, content to put on it, you could just keep these and it's just like connect, you know, OK. Or we could have just like a splash page or something. Or maybe there's not even an external facing piece and it's all just behind.

**CO:** I think for future it would be nice. That's why I say pull up Gensler's. I'm just trying to get an idea so it says the premise of the research. Look at that as kind of a model because I think at some point, not day one, but maybe near future, right?

*(Discussion of Gensler's research website)*

**CO:** We're not here yet, but as you think about a splash page, it can be built to start to be additive, but at least it shows you the topics and I think if you were to go on those, it just shows publications, but it doesn't show you the soup just yet. But anyway, I think anchoring it to our side's awesome.

---

## Action Items Summary

**CO:** All right. So I guess we'll circle back. Go ahead and get with Lisa. Go ahead and get with Craig. And then you're going to talk to Terry about the hours, say we're going to use what we did last year. OK, see what he says.

**AW:** So last time I when I get back with you after that, when I went to e-mail Lauren about the hours and processes, everything like mid-December, I kind of like opened up a can of worms and I kind of felt there was like other processes that I wasn't aware of that were going on.

**CO:** Historically we have set the budget in December. Because of this year, we always solidified either at end of year or in January. So for this year it is in January. So it's just several conversations in order to get to the final budget.

I mean for one, getting the - the reason it's also delayed is because we hired Lisa in the middle of all this and then we are doing zero based budgeting to where we're not just taking what we did last year and just pulling it in starting fresh. Every firm should do zero based budgeting right based on what the efforts are, what we want to focus on. So that's why it's shifting to this spot too. And typically for our firm, we're closing the books for last year in January. So that kind of helps bring some clarity around it. It'll be a lot better this year.

**AW:** I just don't want to be in like a spot. Put myself in a spot where it looks like I'm trying to jump the gun.

**CO:** Yeah, it's not jumping the gun. No, and actually, I mean, it should help in for our budget, right? So don't feel like you... I feel like I'm super on top of it. So no, just everybody else is not. So I'm saying that because Lisa's not been here that long and she's got a lot on her plate.

---

## Software Blockers

**AW:** I can still like, so I guess the big hiccups for me right now is I don't have the AI models to work with 'cause I need that API key which requires a credit card and like put 5 bucks on it. So that's the hiccup for this one. The other one is like all these databases. So it's like I have to store all this information somewhere and right now I'm doing it on Bluehost, which is kind of like our website thing.

I was hoping that we could move it off of that. It just makes it a lot more streamlined to manipulate all the data and everything. Yeah, I can still keep working on Bluehost, but the main thing I just want to make sure is like they're trying to change around usernames and passwords and who has access to what. And I just, I don't want to be modifying stuff on our website cuz it's pretty janky. It's like if you click the wrong button, like I could take down pfluger.com.

**CO:** Yeah, coordinate that with Craig and just to see if we can get the account username set up. Yeah, and like what he's trying to do. Yeah, cuz I can't really speak to that. I know y'all were talking about the hosting and who could possibly host, I think Craig, you and Craig can help spearhead that. I mean, Lauren's not going to know. It's really just about a zero dollar implication to what we're talking about. So if there's something better, have that conversation with Craig too.

**AW:** So it's like the main ones holding production are the Azure SSO, which is the single sign on, the Bluehost, Cloudflare, Supabase. This is where the data is and then what the truck looks like and then the Claude. Vantage point and open asset are - we talked with Leslie, so we have that one that's figured out.

---

## Launch Date & Marketing

**CO:** OK for the January then I need to set up a date for that.

**AW:** So the other crux is that is after the TASA Midwinter.

**CO:** Yeah. So timing. So if that needs to be the first week of February when people are back, I think find best impact of time when everybody's in their office. So don't do it during a conference. I think it's important for everybody to see. And then we hype it up. Let's get Logan to do an animated pitch, OK, through e-mail or whatever to say... Research coming your way '26, January 31st, whatever, right?

**AW:** Look at the calendar at what best day that is. I mean regardless if it's on a Friday at the end of January or the first week of February, just that conference, do not do it that.

---

## Design Forum & Empowering Leaders

**CO:** So by the way, I need to tell you this thing. We're gonna do a... So every year I've been here, I've done a design call. You have not physically been here while I've had those. What's the design call for? You might ask. I usually do those in January, February with all designers and interior designers and planners, which is Josh and Brenda.

The purpose of that is one inspiring, but it's also to help create what we want this firm to do through action. So you will be a part of that forum. But now I'm giving the baton over to Tony to help lead that.

**AW:** When is that?

**CO:** He's looking for dates right now. But that's strictly with the designers, though. No, it's different this year. It's gonna be directors, not everybody, because we can't afford to have everybody, but it's gonna be directors. At least two to three people per office. And that is not dependent upon role. That's gonna be who are the catalysts to instigate things and empower people?

So for instance, Corpus, it might be Eric and Marlon. So some of these things you were talking about earlier is like we're going to invite some of those parties to the table to say when we talk about our goal as a firm is to create inspiring environments and client experience. What do you think that is?

So that's going to set some action steps, but you'll be a part of that. That agenda is getting developed. But look for that in February, probably. That's nothing for you to help plan for, but you are going to be invited to that party. There's some homework.

**AW:** Because that would be a good one to like kind of introduce the ideas of like people on your projects are gonna be looking at this stuff.

**CO:** So you could have it - it's gonna be the same message 10 times. OK, one, you're launching it to the firm. Two, we'll have this forum quickly to say OK now lead research. Now I'm empowering you to ensure that it's happening in your office.

Believe me, I attack it like a warplan. It's not hitting it up front. We actually got suits on the side. And oh, by the way, I got a coast coming back behind. I hit eight different levels.

I don't think it's any extra work for you. I think it's just basically, hey, you heard me launch. Getting input, but also empowering, right? I mean, that's the first thing I did here as it relates to design thought is I pulled everybody in and versus me telling you what I think a design process is, I'm like, we're going to create this together. So that's what you will be doing as a leader, right? You're pushing this out, but you're going to need an army of instigators.

So we'll be doing it through research. We'll be doing it through Ali on interiors. So it's not just interior designers. I need project managers. I need PAs to understand the importance around interiors, the importance around research, the importance around design process, the importance around educational planning from Brenda.

So each one of you are going to speak to that, but it's empowering to say now why are are there any hiccups to what you heard? You want your input? OK, if not, now help push it, right? Make sure it's happening.

So that's an example of what I did for design, right? Why is this important? Because one, every competitor that's in our warehouse is doing this. If you're not doing it, you're going to die. Just to be very... you're not doing research, you're going to die. We're going to stagnate. Almost setting that tone at the very beginning. Why is research important? It's not a nice to have.

Know that Corgan's been doing it for 30 years now. DLR. So for you saying it's not important, wrong, it is. Or else we won't have a firm in 10 years. Right. Or if we are, we're just doing mechanical and reuse of IDIQ. That's inspiring.

## VP Project Numbers Discussion (End of Meeting - Audio Choppy)

*(Note: Transcript gets fragmented here - likely discussing VP coding with Lisa mentioned but not present)*

**CO:** So there's research for benchmarking that will back here with the project numbers. Is there a specific project within management?

**AW:** Yes. So there it's like X25-RB and then a number. And the concept behind this was to structure the research projects to align with our project structure for like regular architecture projects. They had like some numbers like design, set and development structure documents and the research projects load in that same type of manner. We can mirror and parallel them up with projects.

**CO:** Where is it? I mean, are we talking hours? Are we talking expenses or?

**AW:** Potentially both because starting. So back last year we had a bucket of hours that related to the RB effort. Some of that we shifted as much as best possible to the projects, but we coded at the end of the year RB effort. So on Katherine's working on her research efforts, she had a code to go to, right? So what we want to do is still try a key weight bucket of hours allocated.

**CO:** And then how do we anchor that with time and labor? So we're trying to track hours in the overhead. Indirect kind of sorting out. OK, but quickly tie as much as through the projects. Now some of it's not fun. We're gonna have an application process schedule, so we can be able to be the gatekeeper of that as much as possible, so we'll know how much investment we'll have at the very beginning.

But I know it's something that's really important. We had 2000 hours dedicated last year. We used 762. So there we are. Those hours are worth $50 an hour. And where are there's costs being couched? Is it changing in direct overhead? So then we need to make sure that project gets mapped to the CNP.

So overhead - those projects are out there. That's gonna be the allocation process. So it could be one or two and that's we're gonna be the gatekeepers of that. So we can help regulate time and hours.

**AW:** I can get you all the project numbers if that would help, or the structure behind them. What we need to do is have that with Phil Salyer map all those to CNPs.

**CO:** Those will be the existing fabrics. There will be new projects. We're revamping for them here. So the ones that are out are sunsetted.

**AW:** Let's see if these existing ones are under X25 under our old formatting structure where it was an X number was I believe it was an overhead number and then the 25 is the year. So we predefined ten of them. So it was like X25-RB 01, 02, 03 and we could certainly rebuild them out like a list, like a section of them. We can. We roughly know how many there will be, and if we can just set them up, then I guess I'm not sure how the mapping works or anything beyond that. Yeah, we'd have to get Phil involved.

What information do you need from me? Do you want a list of project numbers? I can circle back with that and say these and what else is out there that's not client related as a project. And then we need to make sure it's mapped to the right cost center, like the right department.

Would it help to know the sub numbers of all those and estimate like hours about how much each one would be potentially? I think I just need the population of the projects OK and then we can...

How many of those are still active? So we're up to, I believe 11. So that was for the existing ones. And then for new ones, if it's 2000 hours, roughly maximum be 200 hours, so 10 projects. So it'd be like 10 to 15 projects for '26. Previously Jackie had set all of them up, but those were the... I believe it's between X01 and 11.

---

## Wrap Up

**CO:** Get your software first. Yeah, gotta get my... Yeah, I have a feeling Craig is... I'm working on it. It's like he's just got so much. Well, he's just got a lot.

**AW:** Yeah, it's like, oh, let's get this ring in the drawer, but it's the drawer. Well, wait, let me see. He understands.

**CO:** Alright, good.
