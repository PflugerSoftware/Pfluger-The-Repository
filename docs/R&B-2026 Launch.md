## Meetings

### Wednesday (1/8) 1pm-2pm — R&B Block 2: Software & Infrastructure
**Messages**
1/7 AW to Craig/Austin:
Hey Craig/Austin, just following up on our meeting and seeing what your availability is Friday afternoon to tackle the username/accounts for the following. Below are the known accounts. I'm not sure if any of these are being switched—if so, the goal would be to cancel/change user/set them up and running. If they can be skipped, great! I have placed "Card" next to the ones that will either need a card on file if the free tier is crossed, or if it is a paid service. With the budget not being passed until end of January, let me know if the Card ones aren't able to be done and we can tackle the non-Card ones first. The main ones holding production are Azure SSO, Bluehost, Cloudflare, Supabase, Claude GUI/API, VP API, and OA API. All the others "work."

Top Priority: Bluehost (HB@gmail, domain@pfluger), Cloudflare (TBD) Card?, Supabase (TBD) Card?, GitHub (JW pfluger as org, research@pfluger, AW@pfluger, LS@pfluger, apps@pfluger) Card, Claude Max 5x (CH@pfluger) → Claude Teams (apps@pfluger) Card, Azure SSO (TBD), Claude API (TBD) Card, VP API (TBD) Included, Mapbox API (apps@pfluger) Card?, Census API (apps@pfluger) Free, Resend API (TBD) Free, OpenAsset API (AW@pfluger, LS@pfluger) Free

Other Vis Setup: Magnific GUI (apps@pfluger) Card, Midjourney GUI (TBD) Card, Google Gemini GUI (TBD) Card, CapCut Pro (TBD) Card, Digital Model Assets (TBD), Apple Developer (apps@pfluger) Card, Figma (LS@pfluger) Card, Unreal Engine (team@pfluger) Free, Twinmotion (team@pfluger) Free, Magnific API (TBD) Card, Gemini API (TBD) Card

### Thursday (1/9) 3pm-4pm - Vision: BD+I Dashboard
**Messages**
1/4
Happy New year everyone, Cody Cunningham seeing a spot on the Calander next week, 1/13 3-4pm. It would be awesome to get this thing online and out to the teams to prep for Tasa Mid Winter as the info in it, is pretty useful. 
Cody Cunningham removed Jacqueline Warner from the chat.
Cody Cunningham removed Heather Blazi from the chat.
Cody Cunningham added David Young to the chat.
3-4 pm on the 13th is open but that is before their meeting with McAllen ISD at 4-5 pm, and the bond presentation to the board that evening at 5:30 pm. There would likely need to be an awareness to finish before 4 pm if possible.

CC: I have a window on Thursday if you're available to visit. 
 
DY: I can’t see the initial part of this conversation. What is the conversation we are trying to arrange?
 
Cody Cunningham changed the group name to Pfluger Vision (BD Tool).

CC: Sorry David, I meant to include the previous thread.  This is our thread with Alex on the BD Dashboard Tool.  Just including you for future conversations as we plan the rollout.  I don't think it's quite ready to roll out (I still want to add the bond data from schoolbondfinder).  
 
CC: I also want more eyes on it providing refinements, including you and Terry M., before we roll it out to MPs and PMs. 

**Attendees:** CC, DY, CO
**Agenda:**

**Data currently in Vision:**
- Districts: name, tier, tax rate, valuation, office controller, revenue totals
- Schools: name, type, enrollment, principal, address, linked Pfluger projects
- Projects: project number/name, yearly billed/spent/compensation
- Activities: subject, type, date, owner, contacts, notes
- Bond Elections: date, result, amount, purpose, votes
- Census: population, income, home values, housing, commute, WFH
- Client Contacts: name, title, email, phone, decision maker flag, notes
- TASA Convention: attendees by district, cross-ref with known contacts, new prospects
- Competition: architecture firms attending, BDC Giants sector rank + revenue, attendee counts
- Firm Detail: who from each competitor is going (names, titles)

**Bond Data Gap** (10 min)
- Bond data already exists - what's missing that SchoolBondFinder has?
- Who provides any additional data? CC or Alex?
- Deadline to add it

**Refinements List** (10 min)
- CC/DY: Name specific changes needed
- Prioritize: must-have vs nice-to-have
- Deadlines to use for TASA Mid Winter

**Tech Blockers** (5 min)
- Database/API decisions from Wednesday must resolve first (Claude, DB, VP, etc)
- Confirm board is aware this blocks rollout

**Sign-Off Criteria** (5 min)
- Define what "ready to roll out" looks like
- Who gives final approval? CC? CO?

**Rollout Plan** (5 min)
- Target date for MPs/PMs
- Delivery method: email, demo, training?
- TASA Mid Winter prep timeline

**Status:** Scheduled
**AW Message (1/6):** Awesome all. Made it for Thurs 3-4. I have added an agenda to keep up on track. Please review and let me know if anything needs a massage. Thanks!
**Outcome:** _TBD_

### Wednesday (1/15) - Project Prism (X25-RB10)
**Messages**
1/4 AW:
Hello everyone, and Happy new year. Seeing some spots next week to set up a regroup on the cost estimator for 2026. Some items to revisit is our gameplan for LHISD, and the other ISDs it has been brought up to, and our relationship with Vermeulens/Alpha, subscription model, and the level of development we are comfortable with in 2026. Let me know yalls thoughts. Thanks!

1/6 Claire (Terry's secretary):
Hey Alex - terry mentioned you're looking to get a meeting set up to touch base on cost mgmt tool?

1/6 AW:
Yes, would love to get something on the calendar ASAP with Terry and Tavo. A few things to cover:
- District outreach status, Tavo mentioned there is a new one
- SaaS Partnership/IP discussion with Vermeulens/Alpha
- Development scope and comfort level
Let me know what works for their schedules this week or early next.

**Attendees:** TH (Terry), JS (Josh, joined mid-call driving), AW
**Agenda:**
1. District outreach status (LHISD + any new conversations)
2. SaaS Partnership/IP with Vermeulens/Alpha
3. Development scope and comfort level for 2026

**Status:** Complete
**Outcome:** See notes below

---

**Meeting Notes (1/15/26):**

**Scope Clarified - Two Domains:**
- **Bond Planning** = estimating new buildings, growth, big bonds (MVP focus)
- **Facilities Management** = ongoing maintenance, deferred maintenance (Phase 2)
- Decision: Building app first, facility maintenance on top. Not the other way around.

**The Three Players:**
| Partner | Role |
|---------|------|
| **Vermeulens** | Cost data licensing - new builds, additions, renovations, $/SF |
| **Alpha** | Facilities assessment - what needs replacing, system-level (1:1 replacement) |
| **CMTA** | MEP engineer, energy/performance analysis, performance contracting (future phase) |

**How It Works:**
- Alpha tells you *what* needs to be replaced
- Vermeulens tells you *how much* it costs
- CMTA would tell you *what to replace it with* for better performance (future)

**Business Model:**
- Bond tool locked unless client is working with Pfluger ("set the playpen")
- Subscription for maintenance tool (reoccurring revenue)
- Build features only when clients pay for them - don't over-engineer
- Low barrier to entry: just give them a login, see who's serious

**Vermeulens Licensing Discussion:**
- Current relationship: Vermeulens charges 2% of project cost for estimates
- Proposed trade: Pfluger gives project data ↔ Vermeulens gives cost data
- Hope: No cash exchange - just data trade (they get value from our project data)
- If Pfluger project uses licensed data → commit to use Vermeulens for estimate
- They keep data current; we get access to their full dataset
- Outside Texas: potential franchise opportunity (Vermeulens sells tool to other architects, royalty back to Pfluger)

**Blair Concern:**
- Is Blair speaking for Vermeulens or just himself?
- TH: "He's always been the highest I've ever talked to"
- Need to go higher before signing any agreements
- Blair may be treating this as his career project vs official Vermeulens partnership

**LP Not Needed Yet:**
- TH: "No" to touching base with Lauren on this
- Only bring LP in when attorney/contracts needed
- Current investment is just AW's time - no budget component yet

**Action Items:**
- [ ] TH/Claire: Email Blair/Vermeulens to discuss licensing for 2026
- [ ] AW + JS: Sit down to walk through cost estimation flow per Terry's explanation
- [ ] Explore: What does licensing look like inside vs outside Texas?
- [ ] Explore: NDA/disclosure with Vermeulens before going deeper

**Districts Discussed:**
- LHISD (current)
- Burnet (example used)
- Del Valle (potential - Dustin)
- Dripping Springs (mentioned as data source)

**Post-Meeting Email (1/15 AW → Claire, cc TH):**
> Hello,
>
> Im following up on some items after our meeting.
>
> NDA: Did we receive a signed NDA back from Vermeulens?
>
> Terry would also like to shoot over a coordination email to Blair and his team prompting a discussion about what the partnership looks like in 2026 and the options of licensing data. Here's a draft:
>
> ---
>
> Blair,
> Happy new year, following up on our conversations around the cost estimating tool. We'd like to explore what a licensing arrangement looks like for 2026 - specifically around data sharing and structuring a long term partnership.
>
> Let me know your availability in the next couple weeks to sit down and talk through the details.
>
> Thanks,
> Terry
>
> ---

> @Terry Hoyle I believe that covers it all?

## 1. Research Hours Policy (CO, LP, LF)

**Decision Owner:** CO, LP, LF
**Decision:** ~~Reverse the "research on the clock" policy and restore OT eligibility for research hours.~~

### UPDATE (1/8/26 CO Meeting)

**Decision: Research stays ON THE CLOCK. No OT.**

CO acknowledged the math ($50k OT vs $255k on-clock) and chose the on-clock path. Expectation is passion-driven work within 40 hours.

**Chain of Command Paradox:**
```
Worker (has idea)
    → tells PM "this is cool, we should do this"
    → PM tells Principal to integrate into client conversations
    → Directors oversee that it happens
```

The person doing the research has no authority to allocate hours. They must convince up the chain. Directors "control" hours but aren't initiating research. Principals talk to clients but aren't doing research. The researcher is at the bottom with ideas but no agency to execute.

**R&B Council (Pitch Panel):**
- CO (Christian Owens) - Chief Design Officer
- BS (Brenda Swirczynski) - Education Facilities Planner
- JS (Josh Sawyer) - Educational Planning Director
- AW (Alex Wickes) - R&B Lead

This panel decides which pitches are "worthy" of R&B effort.

---

### What Counts as "Research" (per CO, 1/8/26)

**IS R&B:**
- Novel ideas that differentiate the firm from competitors
- Must tie to project outcomes quickly
- Must demonstrate results before publishing externally
- Example: Katherine & Braden's Sanctuary Spaces (X25-RB01) - it was "flipping it, an idea"

**IS NOT R&B (just "Best Practices"):**
- Post-occupancy surveys - "We've talked about this for five years"
- Mass timber basics - "Every firm doing architecture should be doing this"
- Materials research (Monse's work) - "Is that really R&B or just how we should be doing best practice?"
- Sustainability/energy modeling - "We're barely talking about it, we need to be on level with competition"

**The Contradiction:**
CO says R&B is for differentiation, but then categorizes anything the firm *should* already be doing as "not R&B." If the firm isn't doing post-occupancy, mass timber, or energy modeling - and competitors are - that's not "best practice," that's a gap.

**The Catch-22:**
1. Can't publish research without project outcomes
2. Can't get research on a project without convincing PM → Principal
3. Can't explore ideas without a project to anchor to
4. But novel ideas by definition don't have projects yet

**CO's actual framework (reading between the lines):**
- R&B = Ideas CO finds interesting that can be tied to active work
- Not R&B = Foundational capability building the firm should fund through normal operations (but doesn't)

### Context

- **Revenue decline:** $75M (2024) → ~$50M (2025) → expected decline in 2026
- **OT was cut firm-wide** to reduce costs during the downturn
- **Research OT got swept** because designers were the only ones using it
- **2026 reality:** Every hour needs to be billable

**The problem:** The on-clock model takes 2,000 billable hours and converts them to research. In a year where we need every hour billing, this costs $300,000 in lost revenue.

**The solution:** The OT model keeps those 2,000 hours billable and moves research to after hours. Cost: $33,350 in overhead.

**The irony:** OT was cut to save money, but this specific cut actually reduces revenue.

### Historical Data

**R&B Department:**
- 11 active projects in 2025 (X25-RB01 through X25-RB11)
- 5 Claude accounts allocated (research1-5@pflugerarchitects.com)
- ~7 active researchers

**2025 Research Hours (actual):** 726 total
- Hours by research project: 253, 199, 129, 72, 49, 23, 1
- 7 researchers logged hours

**2026 Research Hours (approved):** 2,000

**Gap:** 2025 actual (726) was only 36% of 2026 target. Research is already being suppressed under current model.

**Quote from PM** (when trying to allocate two staff to research, not even on project hours):
> For a 200+ hour scope reduced to 140 hours "Try to increase the efficiency of the process by removing 33% of the hours."

This is the reality: even when research is approved, PMs push back to cut hours. On-clock research will always lose to billable work.

**The math of "free" research:**

If the expectation is 2,000 hours of unpaid labor from 7 researchers:
- ~285 hrs/person/year
- ~5.5 hrs/week of free work
- On top of 40 billable hours
- With no compensation

The 726 vs 2,000 gap shows people aren't doing it. And they won't.

### The Math

**Assumptions:**
- Employee hourly rate: $50/hr
- Billing rate to client: $150/hr (3x)
- Utilization target: 85% (34 billable hrs/week expected)
- Research OT rate: $50/hr (1:1, not 1.5x)
- Old policy: First 4 hrs/week research unpaid, paid after
- Example: 1 person doing 8 hrs research/week

---

**Option A: Research on OT (Old Model)**

| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Revenue | 34 billable hrs × $150 (85% utilization) | +$5,100/week |
| Base wages | 40 hrs × $50 | -$2,000/week |
| Research OT | 4 hrs × $50 (first 4 unpaid) | -$200/week |
| **Net** | | **+$2,900/week** |
| **Annual** | × 52 weeks | **+$150,800/year** |

**Utilization:** 85% maintained (research is after hours)

---

**Option B: Research on Clock (Current Policy)**

| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Revenue | 27 billable hrs × $150 (8 hrs to research, 32 avail × 85%) | +$4,050/week |
| Base wages | 40 hrs × $50 | -$2,000/week |
| **Net** | | **+$2,050/week** |
| **Annual** | × 52 weeks | **+$106,600/year** |

**Utilization hit:** 85% target → 67.5% actual (8 hrs research out of 40)

---

**Per Researcher (8 hrs research/week):**

| | Option A (OT) | Option B (On Clock) | Difference |
|-|---------------|---------------------|------------|
| Weekly net | +$2,900 | +$2,050 | -$850/week |
| Annual net | +$150,800 | +$106,600 | **-$44,200/year** |
| Utilization | 85% (maintained) | 67.5% (17.5pt drop) | |

---

**At Scale: 2,000 Approved Research Hours (10 projects @ 200 hrs each)**

| | Option A (OT) | Option B (On Clock) |
|-|---------------|---------------------|
| Research hours | 2,000 | 2,000 |
| OT cost | 1,000 hrs × $50 = $50,000 (50% paid at 8hr/wk) | $0 |
| Lost billing (at 85% util) | $0 | 2,000 × $150 × 85% = $255,000 |
| **Total impact** | **-$50,000** | **-$255,000** |

**The question: Do you want 2,000 research hours for $50k or $255k?**

**2026 with 2,000 Research Hours - Compared to Baseline (No Research):**

To integrate 2,000 hours of research, there are two approaches:

| | Option A: On Clock (New) | Option B: OT (Old) |
|-|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Lost revenue (at 85% util) | -$255,000 | $0 |
| Overhead (OT) | $0 | -$50,000 |
| **Impact** | **-$255,000 lost revenue** | **-$50,000 overhead** |

**To get the same 2,000 hours of research:**
- Option A (on clock): **$255,000 in lost revenue** + utilization drops 85% → 67.5%
- Option B (OT): **$50,000 in overhead** + utilization maintained at 85%

**Option B delivers the same research output at 1/5th the cost, as overhead instead of lost revenue.**

### Additional Consequences

1. **Zero project friction** - Under OT model, research doesn't compete with project deadlines
2. **Employee incentive** - If OT is only available for research, research becomes desirable
3. **Training enablement** - Ezra training can happen during research OT, not billable hours

### Recommendation

Restore research OT eligibility. Use Ezra adoption as the pilot program.

### Consequence of Delay

- Cannot finalize database, apps, hosting
- Cannot roll out Vision, Prism or R&B
- Ezra (research assistant) won't run, searching is all manual
- Static CRM  data, two sources of truth

---

## 3. Public Launch (CO, CC)

**Decision Owner:** CO, CC
**Decision:** Approve public-facing content, branding, and marketing pipeline

### What Needs Review

**Content:**
- [ ] Research project descriptions (12 projects)
- [ ] About/Process/Tools page copy
- [ ] Use of AI transparency statement
- [ ] Map presentation of confidential projects (currently show as locked)

**Branding:**
- [ ] Color palette alignment (currently using Pfluger brand colors)
- [ ] Typography consistency
- [ ] Logo usage on platform
- [ ] URL/domain decision (ezra.pfluger? research.pfluger?)

**Marketing Pipeline:**
- [ ] Texas Architect submissions (e.g., X25-RB01 Sanctuary Spaces)
- [ ] Conference presentations (A4LE LearningScapes, etc.)
- [ ] External research shareouts
- [ ] Case studies and white papers
- [ ] Social media / firm website content

### The Problem

Research is completed but sits unpublished. Marketing integration unclear. No clear path from "research done" to "research visible."

### Consequence of Delay

- Cannot launch public-facing pages
- Research investment yields no external visibility
- Firm differentiation doesn't happen
- Thought leadership stays internal with no internal awareness mechanism
- Competitive advantage from research unrealized

---

## 4. Internal Launch (CO, CC, CB)

**Decision Owner:** CO, CB
**Decision:** Approve internal dashboard for research team

### What Needs Review

- [ ] Dashboard functionality scope
- [ ] Ezra AI assistant approach
- [ ] Pitch submission workflow
- [ ] Analytics/metrics visibility

### Consequence of Delay

Research team continues using spreadsheets/email. No centralized project tracking.

---

## 5. Vantage Point + Staff Assignment (LP, LF, JS, CO)

**Decision Owner:** LP, LF (codes), JS (people leaders), CO (direction)
**Decision:** Create VP codes AND establish communication chain for staff assignment

### The Problem

Two things need to happen:

1. **VP codes must exist** - Without codes, hours have nowhere to go
2. **Staff must be assigned** - Alex cannot talk to employees directly; someone must communicate through People Leaders → PMs

As of 1/4 there is a new VP job structure for overhead. But creating new project codes requires approval, and assigning staff requires going through the proper chain.

### VP Code Structure

| Code Type | Purpose | Where It Lives |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| R&B Training | One-time onboarding allocation | Sub-code under R&B General (overhead) |
| X26-RBxx Project Numbers | Track research participation hours | Individual project codes |

### Communication Chain for Staff Assignment

**Original assumption:**
```
Leadership Decision (CO/JS)
        ↓
People Leaders (office leads, dept heads)
        ↓
Project Managers
        ↓
Staff assigned to R&B project numbers
```

**Actual (per 1/8 meeting) - The Paradox:**
```
Worker (has idea, no authority)
        ↓
tells PM "this is cool, we should do this"
        ↓
PM tells Principal to integrate into client conversations
        ↓
Directors oversee that it happens
```

**The problem:** The person with the idea is at the bottom. They must convince up the chain to get hours. Directors "control" hours but don't initiate research. Principals are client-facing but aren't researching. The worker has vision but no agency.

---

### Design Forum (NEW - per 1/8 meeting)

**What:** Tony Schmitz (TS) is now leading design shareouts/forums. R&B will be part of the agenda.

**Who:** Directors + 2-3 "catalysts" per office (not just designers - includes PMs, PAs)

**Purpose (per CO):** "Empower instigators" to ensure research happens in each office. Create an "army of instigators."

**Timing & Location:**
- Day and a half workshop in San Antonio
- Scheduled right AFTER TASA Midwinter (conference ends Tue/Wed, workshop Wed/Thu)
- PMs will already be in San Antonio for the conference - minimizes travel cost
- Tony is finalizing the attendee list (tied to budget)

**R&B at the Forum:**
- Doesn't need to be a 20 minute presentation - just a heads-up
- Goal: Let directors know R&B is coming before it launches
- Message: "Your people are gonna be excited about it. Here's the best ways to support them."

**Additional Coupling (per CO):**
- AW to be partnered with Chad Martin + potential new BIM manager
- Focus: Process and design technology alignment
- CO: "Getting you coupled with this group is pretty important"

**The Additional Layer:**
```
R&B Council approves pitch
        ↓
Design Forum "empowers" catalysts
        ↓
Catalysts tell... their office?... to care about research?
        ↓
But hours still controlled by Directors
        ↓
Who weren't part of the pitch decision
```

**The problem:** This adds inspiration/motivation theater but doesn't solve the authority gap. Catalysts can be "empowered" all day, but if Directors control hours and weren't involved in approving the pitch, the catalyst still has to convince up the chain.

**Action Item:** AW to coordinate with Tony on forum date and get R&B on the agenda.

---

**The gap:** Alex controls the R&B projects in VP but cannot directly assign or communicate with staff. Someone at leadership level must:
1. Inform People Leaders that research participation is legitimate
2. People Leaders tell PMs that staff can bill to R&B codes
3. PMs actually assign people

### Consequence of No Action

Without codes:
- Researchers can't log time
- Hours get buried in project overhead (inaccurate, PM friction)
- Audit risk from incorrect logging

Without communication chain:
- Staff don't know they can participate
- PMs don't know research is approved use of time
- Research stays siloed to those who already know

### The Real Question

It's not "how do we allocate training or research time?"

It's: **Does R&B participation have a legitimate home in the timesheet, AND does anyone know about it?**

If codes exist but no one knows, adoption fails. If people know but codes don't exist, they can't participate.
