00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:20.272
<v Wendy Rosamond>So a lot of this,
the reason I'm asking these questions is</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/47-1
00:00:20.272 --> 00:00:24.672
<v Wendy Rosamond>to say, OK,
visually I know which one you know, which.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/47-2
00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:29.712
<v Wendy Rosamond>Let's see, let me get back here.
Which is your favorite chair?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/47-3
00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:32.752
<v Wendy Rosamond>So I've got one that's a clear winner.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/71-0
00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:38.035
<v Wendy Rosamond>Then I have a second one that's a short
second behind, you know,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/43-0
00:00:34.032 --> 00:00:34.192
<v Alex Wickes>Yep.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/71-1
00:00:38.035 --> 00:00:43.681
<v Wendy Rosamond>chair one and then chair four,
but it even it's really close to chair</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/71-2
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:47.552
<v Wendy Rosamond>two.
So what I have to do is be able to say OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/109-0
00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:54.609
<v Wendy Rosamond>The these are the students preferences
and then I have to have a conversation</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/109-1
00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:00.501
<v Wendy Rosamond>with the teachers and say OK teacher,
this is the teachers preferences because</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/109-2
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:05.796
<v Wendy Rosamond>they are not necessarily here.
This is another question like how often</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/109-3
00:01:05.796 --> 00:01:06.392
<v Wendy Rosamond>are you?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/113-0
00:01:06.472 --> 00:01:09.392
<v Wendy Rosamond>Let me see, there's a question.
How often are you moving?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/121-0
00:01:10.272 --> 00:01:11.472
<v Alex Wickes>Did both?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/157-0
00:01:10.592 --> 00:01:16.912
<v Wendy Rosamond>How often are you rearranging the desk?
So that question is also asked by the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/157-1
00:01:16.912 --> 00:01:23.150
<v Wendy Rosamond>teachers and so that if it is the
teachers who is moving it 80% of the time,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/157-2
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.472
<v Wendy Rosamond>the fact that the students like you know.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/215-0
00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:30.636
<v Wendy Rosamond>This particular desk,
they're not moving those desks as much.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/215-1
00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:34.852
<v Wendy Rosamond>So I have to look at that.
I have to kind of really look at the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/165-0
00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:32.072
<v Alex Wickes>Hmm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/215-2
00:01:34.852 --> 00:01:38.342
<v Wendy Rosamond>inside of like the teachers like this
desk. However,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/215-3
00:01:38.342 --> 00:01:41.899
<v Wendy Rosamond>some of the comments are that that it
moves too much,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/185-0
00:01:38.872 --> 00:01:40.032
<v Alex Wickes>Gotcha.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/215-4
00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.312
<v Wendy Rosamond>the wheels move too much or they're
broken or you know, something.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/256-0
00:01:46.312 --> 00:01:51.303
<v Wendy Rosamond>Something's not functioning right,
so they like the idea of this desk.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/256-1
00:01:51.303 --> 00:01:56.856
<v Wendy Rosamond>So I have to like mentally say I have to
take this data and then I have to dig</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/256-2
00:01:56.856 --> 00:02:00.441
<v Wendy Rosamond>deeper and say, OK,
This is why this is preferred.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/256-3
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:05.712
<v Wendy Rosamond>We need to start making changes to this
desk in order to make it work for.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/269-0
00:02:06.672 --> 00:02:12.032
<v Wendy Rosamond>For both the teachers and the students,
so it might be go ahead.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/263-0
00:02:10.272 --> 00:02:11.272
<v Alex Wickes>Did both.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/317-0
00:02:12.392 --> 00:02:14.966
<v Alex Wickes>Oh,
did both the teachers and the students</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/317-1
00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:19.634
<v Alex Wickes>receive the same survey or did they
receive? They received different surveys.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/295-0
00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:20.192
<v Wendy Rosamond>No, different surveys. Yeah, different.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/317-2
00:02:19.634 --> 00:02:23.524
<v Alex Wickes>So are we able to see,
like if we're talking about functionality</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/317-3
00:02:23.524 --> 00:02:26.995
<v Alex Wickes>of these desks,
is desk one the same as what the students</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/317-4
00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:28.072
<v Alex Wickes>are talking about?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/321-0
00:02:28.432 --> 00:02:30.192
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yes, yes.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/353-0
00:02:29.192 --> 00:02:32.938
<v Alex Wickes>OK, so there is still link.
Like if if somebody is referencing like</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/353-1
00:02:32.938 --> 00:02:37.401
<v Alex Wickes>the majority of teachers preferred this
whiteboard and the students say we don't</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/353-2
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:40.926
<v Alex Wickes>like that whiteboard because of the glare
from our perspective,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/353-3
00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:44.672
<v Alex Wickes>they're still they're everyone's talking
about the same whiteboard.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/389-0
00:02:44.952 --> 00:02:49.166
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yes, yes.
Everybody got the same desks and the same</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/355-0
00:02:45.912 --> 00:02:46.032
<v Alex Wickes>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/389-1
00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:53.947
<v Wendy Rosamond>chairs for students.
The teachers got a variety of the the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/389-2
00:02:53.947 --> 00:03:00.105
<v Wendy Rosamond>four classrooms got different teacher
desks and different different teacher</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/389-3
00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:00.672
<v Wendy Rosamond>chairs.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/387-0
00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:01.672
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/434-0
00:03:01.232 --> 00:03:06.791
<v Wendy Rosamond>So that is independent per that classroom.
And so that insight going into the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/434-1
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:12.635
<v Wendy Rosamond>teacher's information is very helpful as
well to understand which ones they like,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/434-2
00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:16.554
<v Wendy Rosamond>didn't like,
but the students desks and chairs are all</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/434-3
00:03:16.554 --> 00:03:19.832
<v Wendy Rosamond>the same.
So the questions that we're asking.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/426-0
00:03:17.872 --> 00:03:18.352
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/474-0
00:03:20.152 --> 00:03:25.073
<v Wendy Rosamond>The students are a little bit different,
but the same and the same answers we need.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/474-1
00:03:25.073 --> 00:03:28.647
<v Wendy Rosamond>Like you know how,
what are your complaints about the desks?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/474-2
00:03:28.647 --> 00:03:31.517
<v Wendy Rosamond>You know,
those kind of things from a teacher's,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/474-3
00:03:31.517 --> 00:03:35.032
<v Wendy Rosamond>from a teacher's perspective and the
student's perspective.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/535-0
00:03:34.032 --> 00:03:38.279
<v Alex Wickes>Can we go over some of these questions
like this functionality one like what?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/480-0
00:03:38.232 --> 00:03:38.952
<v Wendy Rosamond>Insurance.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/535-1
00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:41.437
<v Alex Wickes>Like what are what are they?
What are they talking about?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/535-2
00:03:41.437 --> 00:03:45.575
<v Alex Wickes>Like when you like functionality,
what are your complaints about the desks?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/535-3
00:03:45.575 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Alex Wickes>So these are the all of the answers of
the students.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/535-4
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.019
<v Alex Wickes>So it's like some of the desks are very
small.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/535-5
00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.632
<v Alex Wickes>I'm not sure some of them are too high
some of.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/528-0
00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:53.792
<v Wendy Rosamond>Mhm, mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/559-0
00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:58.565
<v Alex Wickes>O you would be trying to find from this
like what are the students saying about</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/559-1
00:03:58.565 --> 00:04:01.607
<v Alex Wickes>these desks?
And then what are the teachers saying</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/549-0
00:03:59.152 --> 00:04:00.832
<v Wendy Rosamond>That's right.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/559-2
00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:04.112
<v Alex Wickes>about the desks and how does that align U?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/609-0
00:04:04.072 --> 00:04:07.826
<v Wendy Rosamond>Exactly.
That's that's what I'm trying to count.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/570-0
00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:08.192
<v Alex Wickes>Gotcha.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/609-1
00:04:07.826 --> 00:04:11.273
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yes,
those are the the questions and and and</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/609-2
00:04:11.273 --> 00:04:17.708
<v Wendy Rosamond>results that I really need is is the ones
that are from a teacher's perspective and</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/609-3
00:04:17.708 --> 00:04:23.223
<v Wendy Rosamond>from the student's perspective.
I need kind of a breakdown kind of in a</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/609-4
00:04:23.223 --> 00:04:23.912
<v Wendy Rosamond>separate.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/614-0
00:04:23.912 --> 00:04:26.712
<v Wendy Rosamond>This is student's opinion.
This is teacher's opinion.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/657-0
00:04:26.592 --> 00:04:30.596
<v Alex Wickes>Gotcha. So for this one,
when they're talking about functionality,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/657-1
00:04:30.596 --> 00:04:35.496
<v Alex Wickes>what are your complaints about the desks?
Are they referencing a specific product</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/657-2
00:04:35.496 --> 00:04:39.201
<v Alex Wickes>or is this just talking overall like your
overall experience?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/641-0
00:04:35.592 --> 00:04:36.952
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/651-0
00:04:39.072 --> 00:04:39.272
<v Wendy Rosamond>This.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/657-3
00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:41.352
<v Alex Wickes>It's just these one that you showed?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/659-0
00:04:41.592 --> 00:04:41.672
<v Alex Wickes>Um.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/675-0
00:04:41.632 --> 00:04:46.524
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah,
so there's there's an image of each desk</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/675-1
00:04:46.524 --> 00:04:52.352
<v Wendy Rosamond>of 123 and actually that should say 4,
the 4th one the.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/715-0
00:04:54.152 --> 00:04:59.655
<v Wendy Rosamond>The problem is that it didn't.
The answer didn't link to which one they</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/715-1
00:04:59.655 --> 00:05:03.247
<v Wendy Rosamond>liked. This is one of them that's missing.
So.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/700-0
00:05:01.992 --> 00:05:05.552
<v Alex Wickes>Oh gosh, I I see what you mean.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/715-2
00:05:03.247 --> 00:05:09.590
<v Wendy Rosamond>So what we can say is that they are too,
too tall for the short people and so some</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/715-3
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.952
<v Wendy Rosamond>of them are too high and so those
comments.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/752-0
00:05:13.872 --> 00:05:20.049
<v Wendy Rosamond>Help me regardless of the of the desk
that it would be really great if these</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/752-1
00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Wendy Rosamond>were height adjustable to be able to
accommodate that.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/752-2
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.112
<v Wendy Rosamond>And so if there's enough of those
comments, I can say OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/762-0
00:05:28.472 --> 00:05:33.015
<v Alex Wickes>That's why they're liking disk 3,
because they're talking about adjustable</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/762-1
00:05:33.015 --> 00:05:34.832
<v Alex Wickes>height. Is that what you mean?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/795-0
00:05:33.272 --> 00:05:36.698
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah, like that.
Like if there were things that they'd</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/795-1
00:05:36.698 --> 00:05:41.245
<v Wendy Rosamond>like to say that they would like
different or that they feel is missing,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/773-0
00:05:40.752 --> 00:05:41.232
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/795-2
00:05:41.245 --> 00:05:46.227
<v Wendy Rosamond>like like some of the deaths are too
small, some of the deaths are off balance.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/795-3
00:05:46.227 --> 00:05:51.272
<v Wendy Rosamond>So we need to figure out some of them.
There were some comments about that they.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/839-0
00:05:51.352 --> 00:05:55.894
<v Wendy Rosamond>They need to be bigger and then some of
them, let's see,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/839-1
00:05:55.894 --> 00:06:00.276
<v Wendy Rosamond>there was one that would the casters were
falling off.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/839-2
00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:05.614
<v Wendy Rosamond>This one isn't moves easily because of
wheels on every side of it.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/839-3
00:06:05.614 --> 00:06:10.952
<v Wendy Rosamond>It's so I need to comment,
look at that and see how many comments.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/884-0
00:06:11.112 --> 00:06:18.086
<v Wendy Rosamond>Related to the casters are saying I don't
want all all of the legs to have casters,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/884-1
00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:24.064
<v Wendy Rosamond>so let's let's come up with the middle
ground of two and then this one,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/884-2
00:06:24.064 --> 00:06:30.540
<v Wendy Rosamond>the bar in the middle is is terrible,
so it is really affecting how deep they</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/865-0
00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:25.112
<v Alex Wickes>Hmm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/884-3
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.872
<v Wendy Rosamond>can.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/891-0
00:06:30.872 --> 00:06:34.032
<v Wendy Rosamond>How they can actually sit at the table so.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/932-0
00:06:33.272 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah, it's yeah, you like scroll up.
It's like you had two comments that are</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/932-1
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.131
<v Alex Wickes>directly about wheels not moving.
So then you would go back to the desks</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/909-0
00:06:39.192 --> 00:06:39.552
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/932-2
00:06:42.131 --> 00:06:45.202
<v Alex Wickes>options and be like, well,
which one is not moving?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/932-3
00:06:45.202 --> 00:06:49.809
<v Alex Wickes>Therefore we can say that the students
were hinting at this desk with movable</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/927-0
00:06:49.112 --> 00:06:50.032
<v Wendy Rosamond>Mm-hmm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/932-4
00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:52.112
<v Alex Wickes>wheels is not one that they would like.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/956-0
00:06:52.832 --> 00:06:56.432
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah.
And also there was that they're saying</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/956-1
00:06:56.432 --> 00:07:01.712
<v Wendy Rosamond>they're they're moving around too much or
one of them said, well,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/938-0
00:07:01.312 --> 00:07:01.472
<v Alex Wickes>Yep.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/956-2
00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:06.752
<v Wendy Rosamond>actually there were many of them that
said that they transfer.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/956-3
00:07:06.752 --> 00:07:08.672
<v Wendy Rosamond>That means that the top.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/992-0
00:07:09.272 --> 00:07:15.049
<v Wendy Rosamond>Laminate of the desk is transferring,
you know, marker, pen, pencil.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/963-0
00:07:11.872 --> 00:07:11.952
<v Alex Wickes>Uh.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/992-1
00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:21.580
<v Wendy Rosamond>So that to me is not it is a function,
but it's also something that I need to</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/992-2
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.352
<v Wendy Rosamond>resolve like OK,
we need to come up with a more durable.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1024-0
00:07:26.552 --> 00:07:32.312
<v Wendy Rosamond>Material or a different pattern that was
on the sample.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1024-1
00:07:32.312 --> 00:07:40.644
<v Wendy Rosamond>So like I there's like a multi-layer of
reasoning for asking these questions and</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1024-2
00:07:40.644 --> 00:07:42.392
<v Wendy Rosamond>it's really also.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1070-0
00:07:42.472 --> 00:07:47.127
<v Wendy Rosamond>helpful to see that the students are
saying that that it's tell that it's</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1070-1
00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:51.781
<v Wendy Rosamond>transferring and this and the teachers
are saying that it's transferring.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1038-0
00:07:50.112 --> 00:07:50.792
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1070-2
00:07:51.781 --> 00:07:56.624
<v Wendy Rosamond>So So I'm seeing comments just going
through you know these descriptions and</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1070-3
00:07:56.624 --> 00:08:01.592
<v Wendy Rosamond>you know half of them are not useful but
that's okay but the ones that are are</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1060-0
00:08:00.072 --> 00:08:00.792
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1111-0
00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:05.908
<v Wendy Rosamond>Really helpful.
Like they need to be bigger.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1090-0
00:08:05.672 --> 00:08:07.977
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah, yeah,
it doesn't have a lot of space.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1111-1
00:08:05.908 --> 00:08:11.218
<v Wendy Rosamond>So bigger meaning, yeah.
And then this one's too big, too small,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1090-1
00:08:07.977 --> 00:08:10.072
<v Alex Wickes>It's uncomfortable. There's round edges.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1111-2
00:08:11.218 --> 00:08:15.384
<v Wendy Rosamond>too big, need to be bigger.
So it that's all that.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1111-3
00:08:15.384 --> 00:08:21.592
<v Wendy Rosamond>I wanted to leave that as an open comment
because some of the comments are.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1114-0
00:08:21.672 --> 00:08:24.592
<v Wendy Rosamond>Um, more insightful than others.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1115-0
00:08:24.472 --> 00:08:24.952
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1151-0
00:08:27.912 --> 00:08:32.837
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah, and and and it's OK that, you know,
half of them aren't as useful,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1120-0
00:08:28.432 --> 00:08:28.592
<v Alex Wickes>Mm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1151-1
00:08:32.837 --> 00:08:36.750
<v Wendy Rosamond>but the ones that are,
if we can align it with any of the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1151-2
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:42.013
<v Wendy Rosamond>teachers comments, because these are,
we just have a lot of comments and some</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1151-3
00:08:42.013 --> 00:08:42.552
<v Wendy Rosamond>of them.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1169-0
00:08:42.872 --> 00:08:47.895
<v Wendy Rosamond>Um, uh,
really put into some thought into this</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1169-1
00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:50.352
<v Wendy Rosamond>and you know everybody.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1190-0
00:08:49.392 --> 00:08:51.679
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah, no, I mean,
a lot of these comments are like,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1190-1
00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:54.230
<v Alex Wickes>they're really good.
Like they wrote a lot and it's like,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1228-0
00:08:53.672 --> 00:08:59.596
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah, there was there was one I wanted.
I want to show you this one going down.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1190-2
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.912
<v Alex Wickes>I really don't have the comments desk at
the end of the day.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1228-1
00:08:59.596 --> 00:09:05.076
<v Wendy Rosamond>It's a very end for the students.
I was really excited to see the overall</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1228-2
00:09:05.076 --> 00:09:09.149
<v Wendy Rosamond>experience. Any other questions?
Because some of them,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1228-3
00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:13.592
<v Wendy Rosamond>you could tell some of them thought about
it, some of them.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1233-0
00:09:13.672 --> 00:09:16.672
<v Wendy Rosamond>Really didn't care, but um.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1243-0
00:09:15.032 --> 00:09:20.872
<v Alex Wickes>Yep. They're just like, Nope, no, no,
none. Nope, not, not, Nope, Nope.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1238-0
00:09:17.992 --> 00:09:19.392
<v Wendy Rosamond>No, no, no.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1280-0
00:09:20.152 --> 00:09:25.329
<v Wendy Rosamond>And then I I like my one of my most
favorite is we should allow phones in</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1244-0
00:09:21.752 --> 00:09:22.032
<v Alex Wickes>Yes.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1280-1
00:09:25.329 --> 00:09:28.756
<v Wendy Rosamond>schools.
Teachers should be obligated to give us</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1280-2
00:09:28.756 --> 00:09:34.143
<v Wendy Rosamond>candy cushions on the course as well.
Let us have free time 90% of the class</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1280-3
00:09:34.143 --> 00:09:34.632
<v Wendy Rosamond>period.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1318-0
00:09:35.432 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Wendy Rosamond>And then this one was the most insightful.
I I hadn't really gone through all the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1318-1
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.608
<v Wendy Rosamond>others,
but I don't know if you remember that</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1296-0
00:09:41.832 --> 00:09:41.872
<v Alex Wickes>Uh.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1318-2
00:09:44.608 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Wendy Rosamond>they ended up changing the name of Lee
High School used to be Lee,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1318-3
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.632
<v Wendy Rosamond>then they changed it to Legacy.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1368-0
00:09:52.272 --> 00:09:58.018
<v Wendy Rosamond>During COVID, they changed it back to Lee,
but they named it off after a different</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1315-0
00:09:52.752 --> 00:09:52.792
<v Alex Wickes>Uh.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1368-1
00:09:58.018 --> 00:10:02.657
<v Wendy Rosamond>person who had the same name.
Um So it's kind of a trickery thing.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1368-2
00:10:02.657 --> 00:10:07.226
<v Wendy Rosamond>And so one of the students finally said
something about it, like,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1368-3
00:10:07.226 --> 00:10:12.072
<v Wendy Rosamond>why would you rename the school up to
Confederate General, which was.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1401-0
00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:20.220
<v Wendy Rosamond>It was generally Lee and it was now named
after a different Lee, but still it is,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1401-1
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.867
<v Wendy Rosamond>you know, it was, it's Midland.
They're there.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1401-2
00:10:24.867 --> 00:10:29.712
<v Wendy Rosamond>They followed the the trend of the
conservative.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1443-0
00:10:29.752 --> 00:10:33.977
<v Wendy Rosamond>Mindset. So anyway,
they so some of these are good comments,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1443-1
00:10:33.977 --> 00:10:37.232
<v Wendy Rosamond>some of them like chocolate cookies,
you know,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1443-2
00:10:37.232 --> 00:10:41.804
<v Wendy Rosamond>chocolate chip cookies and all that.
But but some of them are OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1443-3
00:10:41.804 --> 00:10:46.236
<v Wendy Rosamond>They want bigger deaths than even the
ones that are sitting in.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1443-4
00:10:46.236 --> 00:10:47.552
<v Wendy Rosamond>So I don't know so.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1439-0
00:10:46.552 --> 00:10:47.032
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1458-0
00:10:48.032 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Wendy Rosamond>You know,
thinking about all this of of how we can</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1458-1
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:59.792
<v Wendy Rosamond>weed through and and really just include
comments that are helpful to us.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1457-0
00:11:00.232 --> 00:11:00.832
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1534-0
00:11:03.392 --> 00:11:06.569
<v Alex Wickes>So I think for this too,
I think the the best strategy for that</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1534-1
00:11:06.569 --> 00:11:10.441
<v Alex Wickes>would probably be to isolate into themes,
like what are the themes people are</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1534-2
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:13.916
<v Alex Wickes>talking about and bringing up.
And that way you could then be able to</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1498-0
00:11:12.552 --> 00:11:12.912
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1534-3
00:11:13.916 --> 00:11:17.986
<v Alex Wickes>relate you know what types of qualitative
aspects people are talking about on the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1534-4
00:11:17.986 --> 00:11:21.312
<v Alex Wickes>themes like you would have a theme of
like size and like what are.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1576-0
00:11:23.152 --> 00:11:27.650
<v Alex Wickes>The size themes people are talking about
are are the majority of the students</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1576-1
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:32.033
<v Alex Wickes>saying that it's too big or is it too
small or is it just being brought up?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1576-2
00:11:32.033 --> 00:11:36.473
<v Alex Wickes>Cause I think then that way then you
could really grab gather those insights</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1576-3
00:11:36.473 --> 00:11:40.913
<v Alex Wickes>like is it like mobility is a theme?
Like what are the students saying about</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1576-4
00:11:40.913 --> 00:11:41.432
<v Alex Wickes>mobility?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1573-0
00:11:40.952 --> 00:11:42.072
<v Wendy Rosamond>Mm-hmm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1580-0
00:11:41.872 --> 00:11:45.112
<v Alex Wickes>Or like transferability.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1585-0
00:11:46.352 --> 00:11:47.952
<v Alex Wickes>Ones like that, I think.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1587-0
00:11:47.792 --> 00:11:48.352
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1606-0
00:11:49.712 --> 00:11:53.130
<v Alex Wickes>Would that be in line?
Because then you could see like the theme,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1606-1
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:56.392
<v Alex Wickes>like comparing the theme between teachers
and students, right?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1630-0
00:11:56.072 --> 00:12:01.687
<v Wendy Rosamond>Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
And then looking at that from from the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1630-1
00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:08.832
<v Wendy Rosamond>Excel perspective of how to take this
information, obviously this is.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1670-0
00:12:11.832 --> 00:12:16.954
<v Wendy Rosamond>This is the teacher,
so it's not going to be this Excel is</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1670-1
00:12:16.954 --> 00:12:21.554
<v Wendy Rosamond>much smaller,
but then being able to utilize that is</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1670-2
00:12:21.554 --> 00:12:28.672
<v Wendy Rosamond>that so that I don't I wouldn't have to
go through and look at each one of these.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1679-0
00:12:28.232 --> 00:12:34.192
<v Alex Wickes>No, no, it we make it graphical. Yeah,
make it look nice there.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1673-0
00:12:29.472 --> 00:12:31.152
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK, OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1683-0
00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:35.952
<v Wendy Rosamond>We could. Would we? Would we be able to?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1700-0
00:12:38.232 --> 00:12:41.628
<v Wendy Rosamond>Organize this,
you know through any of the programs that</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1700-1
00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:43.712
<v Wendy Rosamond>you have or is that something that?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1724-0
00:12:44.152 --> 00:12:47.670
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah, yeah.
So let me let me share here and I'll show</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1708-0
00:12:45.472 --> 00:12:46.032
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1724-1
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:53.011
<v Alex Wickes>you kind of some of these blocks that I
have that we can put all this stuff into.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1716-0
00:12:47.712 --> 00:12:47.832
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1719-0
00:12:51.152 --> 00:12:51.392
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1724-2
00:12:53.011 --> 00:12:53.792
<v Alex Wickes>So this one.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1777-0
00:12:56.112 --> 00:13:00.633
<v Alex Wickes>So this is kind of like our R&amp;
B showcase block showcase.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1777-1
00:13:00.633 --> 00:13:06.540
<v Alex Wickes>So this was one I did for Leah and this
was talking about the different concepts</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1740-0
00:13:01.672 --> 00:13:01.792
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1777-2
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.769
<v Alex Wickes>on just feedback.
So they gave out a survey and like what</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1777-3
00:13:10.769 --> 00:13:12.592
<v Alex Wickes>are people talking about?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1763-0
00:13:10.912 --> 00:13:11.072
<v Wendy Rosamond>Mm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1823-0
00:13:12.672 --> 00:13:15.890
<v Alex Wickes>And so this one's like kind of showing
the different themes.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1823-1
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.582
<v Alex Wickes>So it's like outdoor spaces was a big
theme, separation, flexibility,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1823-2
00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:22.325
<v Alex Wickes>a lot of people were excited about that
visibility,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1823-3
00:13:22.325 --> 00:13:26.123
<v Alex Wickes>storage solutions and then like the
concerns. So it's like sound bleed,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1823-4
00:13:26.123 --> 00:13:28.232
<v Alex Wickes>multiple lobbies, cost of two buildings.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1833-0
00:13:28.392 --> 00:13:31.552
<v Alex Wickes>And this is like the number of hits that
it was in each of the responses.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1830-0
00:13:33.472 --> 00:13:33.632
<v Wendy Rosamond>M.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1873-0
00:13:33.472 --> 00:13:38.284
<v Alex Wickes>And then coming down and being able to
like pull quotes out so we could see all</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1873-1
00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:43.095
<v Alex Wickes>that type of stuff and then kind of just
framing it in kind of this graphics to</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1873-2
00:13:43.095 --> 00:13:46.703
<v Alex Wickes>where then you can come in and be able to
expand on things.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1873-3
00:13:46.703 --> 00:13:50.552
<v Alex Wickes>It's like different stars you could have
like different chairs.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1859-0
00:13:46.872 --> 00:13:47.392
<v Wendy Rosamond>Good.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1880-0
00:13:50.992 --> 00:13:55.552
<v Alex Wickes>Um.
And then we can also then have them in.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1893-0
00:13:57.352 --> 00:14:02.686
<v Alex Wickes>Kind of like a product showcase,
so you can also do different types of</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1893-1
00:14:02.686 --> 00:14:03.512
<v Alex Wickes>charts. Um.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1928-0
00:14:04.912 --> 00:14:08.370
<v Alex Wickes>This one's kind of like, you know,
if we're gonna,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1928-1
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:13.455
<v Alex Wickes>if you have like multiple options,
so it could be like chair 1234 that you</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1928-2
00:14:13.455 --> 00:14:18.608
<v Alex Wickes>can click on it, learn more about it,
have like a price, the picture of it,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1928-3
00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.032
<v Alex Wickes>just some dimensions.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1960-0
00:14:21.392 --> 00:14:25.779
<v Alex Wickes>This one's like a comparison block,
so it could compare between three</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1960-1
00:14:25.779 --> 00:14:29.663
<v Alex Wickes>different four different types,
different properties of them.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1960-2
00:14:29.663 --> 00:14:34.112
<v Alex Wickes>So then you can start bringing in like
the furniture aspects you know.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1950-0
00:14:30.312 --> 00:14:31.432
<v Wendy Rosamond>Mm-hmm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/1954-0
00:14:33.512 --> 00:14:34.992
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK, OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2016-0
00:14:35.072 --> 00:14:38.412
<v Alex Wickes>This is another fun one.
So this is like a block builder,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2016-1
00:14:38.412 --> 00:14:41.349
<v Alex Wickes>so cost builder.
So then you could start selecting</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2016-2
00:14:41.349 --> 00:14:44.689
<v Alex Wickes>different items and then like see the
implications of it.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2016-3
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:49.238
<v Alex Wickes>I could see like this where you had the
furniture game where it's like you you</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2016-4
00:14:49.238 --> 00:14:53.672
<v Alex Wickes>put the different chairs around the table
and you could see it in real time.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2004-0
00:14:53.832 --> 00:14:54.392
<v Wendy Rosamond>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2051-0
00:14:53.912 --> 00:14:58.838
<v Alex Wickes>So you can even see it like here and be
able to have people like play with it,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2051-1
00:14:58.838 --> 00:15:02.642
<v Alex Wickes>be like, Oh well,
we want these like three different things.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2051-2
00:15:02.642 --> 00:15:06.944
<v Alex Wickes>Where are we at versus one?
I feel this the survey block is going to</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2037-0
00:15:04.512 --> 00:15:04.832
<v Wendy Rosamond>No.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2051-3
00:15:06.944 --> 00:15:08.752
<v Alex Wickes>be the most helpful for this.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2071-0
00:15:08.752 --> 00:15:14.900
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah, I think so too.
So do you need me to think about the the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2071-1
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:21.632
<v Wendy Rosamond>different themes or what do you do?
Does the program do that for us?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2074-0
00:15:21.872 --> 00:15:24.992
<v Alex Wickes>It'll, it'll, it'll figure him out.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2078-0
00:15:27.032 --> 00:15:27.152
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2120-0
00:15:28.272 --> 00:15:31.142
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah,
we'll give it the data and then I'll have</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2120-1
00:15:31.142 --> 00:15:35.805
<v Alex Wickes>it run through it and generate a list of
themes on the qualitative feedbacks.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2120-2
00:15:35.805 --> 00:15:40.408
<v Alex Wickes>And then we could review those and then
see like, do we want to add a theme?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2120-3
00:15:40.408 --> 00:15:44.354
<v Alex Wickes>Is there something missing?
And then put it back through and then</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2120-4
00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:44.712
<v Alex Wickes>it'll.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2175-0
00:15:44.912 --> 00:15:48.351
<v Alex Wickes>Churn it out and be able to give out the
insights on the stuff.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2175-1
00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:51.467
<v Alex Wickes>The the qualitative ones I don't think
are the hard ones.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2175-2
00:15:51.467 --> 00:15:55.282
<v Alex Wickes>I think the the more difficult ones is
trying to transcribe like what?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2175-3
00:15:55.282 --> 00:15:58.183
<v Alex Wickes>What are the people actually talking
about? You know,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2175-4
00:15:58.183 --> 00:16:00.869
<v Alex Wickes>like when someone says like, oh,
it's not mobile,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2159-0
00:15:58.352 --> 00:15:59.952
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2175-5
00:16:00.869 --> 00:16:03.072
<v Alex Wickes>like what do you mean by it's not mobile?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2183-0
00:16:04.272 --> 00:16:07.312
<v Alex Wickes>And it'll be able to look at all of the
different.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2205-0
00:16:09.152 --> 00:16:16.265
<v Alex Wickes>Written responses and kind of then like
figure out what people are talking about,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2239-0
00:16:14.712 --> 00:16:18.980
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah, OK.
And So what what what they what it spits</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2205-1
00:16:16.265 --> 00:16:17.392
<v Alex Wickes>you know, so.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2239-1
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:24.920
<v Wendy Rosamond>back at us if we if we say, OK,
we need to rethink this terminology of</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2239-2
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:31.112
<v Wendy Rosamond>you know if they're if it's making an
assumption what that means is that.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2231-0
00:16:30.992 --> 00:16:31.512
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2247-0
00:16:31.872 --> 00:16:35.432
<v Wendy Rosamond>Is that something that we we could edit
and say OK then what that means is?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2270-0
00:16:37.272 --> 00:16:41.178
<v Wendy Rosamond>Where I don't know,
I'd have to think about, you know,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2270-1
00:16:41.178 --> 00:16:45.084
<v Wendy Rosamond>whatever that is,
we'll just maybe just see it when it</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2284-0
00:16:45.032 --> 00:16:48.818
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And then we'll just review and and kind</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2270-2
00:16:45.084 --> 00:16:47.072
<v Wendy Rosamond>comes back to us and say OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2284-1
00:16:48.818 --> 00:16:53.255
<v Alex Wickes>of iterate, iterate around it.
Just think of it like a really smart</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2284-2
00:16:53.255 --> 00:16:53.712
<v Alex Wickes>person.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2281-0
00:16:54.032 --> 00:16:54.152
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2296-0
00:16:55.552 --> 00:16:58.985
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah.
And then just we'll just basically just</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2296-1
00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:00.552
<v Alex Wickes>be talking to it and.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2302-0
00:16:59.832 --> 00:17:05.712
<v Wendy Rosamond>Does it? Does it send you back questions?
Like what does this mean?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2343-0
00:17:06.472 --> 00:17:11.429
<v Alex Wickes>Yes, yeah, because I'll be.
So I'll be using Claude for this and yeah,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2308-0
00:17:08.112 --> 00:17:08.152
<v Wendy Rosamond>Oh.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2312-0
00:17:10.752 --> 00:17:10.872
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2343-1
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:16.735
<v Alex Wickes>I'll I'll have to first clean the data so
it can understand it really well.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2343-2
00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:21.552
<v Alex Wickes>So I'll probably just make a bunch of
different spreadsheet type of.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2387-0
00:17:21.712 --> 00:17:26.884
<v Alex Wickes>Files and then have it review it and then
write U kind of justice like a report of</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2387-1
00:17:26.884 --> 00:17:31.496
<v Alex Wickes>what it found on the base piece and then
help steer it towards, you know,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2387-2
00:17:31.496 --> 00:17:36.792
<v Alex Wickes>finding themes and all this and then give
it the different types of visual outcomes.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2463-0
00:17:37.352 --> 00:17:40.603
<v Alex Wickes>And see then how what it thinks about
like putting the data into those,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2463-1
00:17:40.603 --> 00:17:42.815
<v Alex Wickes>like how would it be best represented?
You know,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2463-2
00:17:42.815 --> 00:17:45.749
<v Alex Wickes>give it some background on like who's
going to be looking at it.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2463-3
00:17:45.749 --> 00:17:47.916
<v Alex Wickes>Like no teachers are going to be looking
at it.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2463-4
00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:51.617
<v Alex Wickes>They're going to need to make like cost
decisions so that it can come back and be</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2433-0
00:17:51.312 --> 00:17:51.552
<v Wendy Rosamond>Right.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2463-5
00:17:51.617 --> 00:17:54.281
<v Alex Wickes>like, oh, well,
do you have any cost information on these?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2463-6
00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:56.312
<v Alex Wickes>Like do you have any websites or cut
sheets?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2490-0
00:17:56.352 --> 00:18:01.699
<v Wendy Rosamond>The good thing is that we're not going to
use this for any cost.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2466-0
00:18:00.032 --> 00:18:01.392
<v Alex Wickes>Oh, perfect.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2490-1
00:18:01.699 --> 00:18:08.196
<v Wendy Rosamond>So we're not going to put any numbers in
here because this is only the project</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2490-2
00:18:08.196 --> 00:18:13.707
<v Wendy Rosamond>manager will look at cost.
We will not be showing anybody anything</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2490-3
00:18:13.707 --> 00:18:15.352
<v Wendy Rosamond>related to cost yet.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2532-0
00:18:15.352 --> 00:18:20.305
<v Wendy Rosamond>I think what based based off of what
these decisions are and kind of the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2484-0
00:18:15.592 --> 00:18:16.392
<v Alex Wickes>Perfect.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2532-1
00:18:20.305 --> 00:18:23.561
<v Wendy Rosamond>analysis,
we then can start to plug in the cost</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2505-0
00:18:22.032 --> 00:18:22.792
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2532-2
00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:28.310
<v Wendy Rosamond>into the overall budget because this was
just for classrooms we have,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2532-3
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.752
<v Wendy Rosamond>you know this is 20% of the project.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2520-0
00:18:28.872 --> 00:18:29.112
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2539-0
00:18:32.552 --> 00:18:36.112
<v Wendy Rosamond>The 80% we're not even doing surveys on.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2583-0
00:18:36.832 --> 00:18:40.173
<v Alex Wickes>Gotcha. OK,
well that makes it super easier.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2583-1
00:18:40.173 --> 00:18:46.260
<v Alex Wickes>If if you could then describe what your
dream situation would be about how people</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2583-2
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.976
<v Alex Wickes>would would receive all of this info,
like would they be like seeing graphs?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2583-3
00:18:51.976 --> 00:18:53.832
<v Alex Wickes>Would it be like a chart?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2602-0
00:18:55.392 --> 00:18:59.083
<v Alex Wickes>Would it be pictures?
And then like what types of mediums?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2584-0
00:18:58.912 --> 00:18:58.952
<v Wendy Rosamond>Uh.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2602-1
00:18:59.083 --> 00:19:03.275
<v Alex Wickes>And then the different types of people
who would be visiting this?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2602-2
00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:06.152
<v Alex Wickes>Would it be like parents, teachers,
students?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2600-0
00:19:07.992 --> 00:19:08.192
<v Wendy Rosamond>Um.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2609-0
00:19:09.832 --> 00:19:14.272
<v Wendy Rosamond>Probably only administration and um.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2655-0
00:19:15.912 --> 00:19:20.399
<v Wendy Rosamond>Project managers at this point would be
looking at this.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2655-1
00:19:20.399 --> 00:19:26.381
<v Wendy Rosamond>I mean this would be something that we we
could inform them after the fact,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2655-2
00:19:26.381 --> 00:19:32.049
<v Wendy Rosamond>but they will not be their level of
involvement. Teachers and students,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2655-3
00:19:32.049 --> 00:19:35.512
<v Wendy Rosamond>their level of involvement is a survey
and.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2659-0
00:19:35.512 --> 00:19:38.072
<v Wendy Rosamond>Being involved in the pilot.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2678-0
00:19:39.192 --> 00:19:44.127
<v Wendy Rosamond>Um, but I mean this, this could be public.
We we could, you know,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2656-0
00:19:39.592 --> 00:19:39.832
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2678-1
00:19:44.127 --> 00:19:47.192
<v Wendy Rosamond>this could be a public kind of thing. Um.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2707-0
00:19:48.712 --> 00:19:52.826
<v Wendy Rosamond>The the idea,
the ultimate goal is to be able to</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2707-1
00:19:52.826 --> 00:19:58.619
<v Wendy Rosamond>visually show them kind of.
I really like the first example you were</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2707-2
00:19:58.619 --> 00:20:03.152
<v Wendy Rosamond>showing that kind of gave the level of
participation.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2705-0
00:20:03.832 --> 00:20:04.472
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2718-0
00:20:04.032 --> 00:20:11.672
<v Wendy Rosamond>Kind of a summary of what this pilot is
for classrooms.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2725-0
00:20:15.992 --> 00:20:16.472
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2760-0
00:20:16.512 --> 00:20:19.716
<v Wendy Rosamond>You know,
we had this level of participation.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2727-0
00:20:16.592 --> 00:20:16.712
<v Alex Wickes>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2760-1
00:20:19.716 --> 00:20:24.312
<v Wendy Rosamond>This is how many students participated,
how many teachers we had.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2760-2
00:20:24.312 --> 00:20:29.675
<v Wendy Rosamond>And then we kind of start start from the
beginning and then just go into the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2760-3
00:20:29.675 --> 00:20:32.112
<v Wendy Rosamond>details showing, you know, this is.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2790-0
00:20:32.152 --> 00:20:40.389
<v Wendy Rosamond>Based off of the student's perspective,
these these were, I know we're blending,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2790-1
00:20:40.389 --> 00:20:48.320
<v Wendy Rosamond>but somehow we want to show what the
students said and and the ones that have</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2781-0
00:20:46.432 --> 00:20:46.752
<v Alex Wickes>Thank you.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2790-2
00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.472
<v Wendy Rosamond>common comments and that a lot.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2837-0
00:20:51.672 --> 00:20:54.978
<v Wendy Rosamond>To each other might be the most
beneficial.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2837-1
00:20:54.978 --> 00:20:59.336
<v Wendy Rosamond>And then a lot of the comments that
ultimately we're not,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2837-2
00:20:59.336 --> 00:21:03.694
<v Wendy Rosamond>we're not locked into any of these four
tables or chairs.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2837-3
00:21:03.694 --> 00:21:09.028
<v Wendy Rosamond>What we want to do is we want to
understand what they liked and didn't</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2837-4
00:21:09.028 --> 00:21:11.432
<v Wendy Rosamond>like and then we will customize.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2876-0
00:21:11.672 --> 00:21:17.848
<v Wendy Rosamond>And figure out what is the right solution
for that. Because miraculously,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2876-1
00:21:17.848 --> 00:21:24.607
<v Wendy Rosamond>we didn't expect that there would be only
one winner. We expected that we would,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2853-0
00:21:22.792 --> 00:21:23.192
<v Alex Wickes>Mm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2876-2
00:21:24.607 --> 00:21:29.530
<v Wendy Rosamond>especially the desks,
because the desks we there's so many</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2876-3
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.032
<v Wendy Rosamond>different options.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2919-0
00:21:31.192 --> 00:21:35.441
<v Wendy Rosamond>Options these these being four,
we can change sizes,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2883-0
00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:34.792
<v Alex Wickes>I.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2919-1
00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:40.091
<v Wendy Rosamond>we can change different details of the
desk all the time.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2919-2
00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:46.584
<v Wendy Rosamond>It is what we need to know is what they
what they would like to have at their at</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2919-3
00:21:46.584 --> 00:21:50.752
<v Wendy Rosamond>their desk and as a, you know,
a common collective.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2911-0
00:21:47.952 --> 00:21:48.472
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2962-0
00:21:51.272 --> 00:21:56.162
<v Wendy Rosamond>And the function of that desk,
the positives and negatives,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2962-1
00:21:56.162 --> 00:22:03.007
<v Wendy Rosamond>the negatives are as just as important as
the positives because that that does help</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2962-2
00:22:03.007 --> 00:22:09.852
<v Wendy Rosamond>us like the the the the transfer that's a
really big deal that might not have to do</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2962-3
00:22:09.852 --> 00:22:10.992
<v Wendy Rosamond>anything with.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2995-0
00:22:11.112 --> 00:22:14.421
<v Wendy Rosamond>The desk,
it had to do with the laminate on that</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2995-1
00:22:14.421 --> 00:22:19.552
<v Wendy Rosamond>desk and so that takes it to another
design level that helps us understand.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2995-2
00:22:19.552 --> 00:22:24.819
<v Wendy Rosamond>We need to make sure that it's not a
light surface, whatever that surface is.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/2995-3
00:22:24.819 --> 00:22:27.992
<v Wendy Rosamond>I think most of them were a light surface,
so.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3014-0
00:22:28.072 --> 00:22:35.699
<v Wendy Rosamond>What we need from our side is to
understand features of each one of these</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3006-0
00:22:34.312 --> 00:22:34.792
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3014-1
00:22:35.699 --> 00:22:39.512
<v Wendy Rosamond>that were the most preferred and why.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3013-0
00:22:40.632 --> 00:22:40.992
<v Alex Wickes>Yep.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3016-0
00:22:43.792 --> 00:22:43.912
<v Alex Wickes>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3027-0
00:22:45.472 --> 00:22:49.192
<v Alex Wickes>This is this is definitely doable.
This will be pretty exciting.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3060-0
00:22:48.552 --> 00:22:51.928
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah,
this is awesome and I really love the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3060-1
00:22:51.928 --> 00:22:56.607
<v Wendy Rosamond>graphics. I think.
I think that is that'll be a really great</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3060-2
00:22:56.607 --> 00:23:02.898
<v Wendy Rosamond>kind of presentation and in a different
way of how we are collecting data and how</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3043-0
00:22:56.912 --> 00:22:57.672
<v Alex Wickes>When you do that.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3060-3
00:23:02.898 --> 00:23:04.432
<v Wendy Rosamond>we can use this and.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3064-0
00:23:04.992 --> 00:23:06.992
<v Wendy Rosamond>Um, make it accessible for all.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3122-0
00:23:07.792 --> 00:23:10.236
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah,
and definitely being able to put this up</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3122-1
00:23:10.236 --> 00:23:13.148
<v Alex Wickes>on that site,
you could send literally send anybody the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3122-2
00:23:13.148 --> 00:23:16.528
<v Alex Wickes>link and have them check it out.
So they could send it to their,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3095-0
00:23:15.192 --> 00:23:17.472
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah, it'd be awesome.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3122-3
00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:20.324
<v Alex Wickes>they could send it to their parents,
they could send it to their people.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3122-4
00:23:20.324 --> 00:23:23.860
<v Alex Wickes>Another aspect on this too,
and maybe if this is just like it needs</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3122-5
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.472
<v Alex Wickes>to be a food for thought thing.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3125-0
00:23:25.832 --> 00:23:28.472
<v Alex Wickes>Would you want people to be able to
interact with this?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3151-0
00:23:30.552 --> 00:23:35.399
<v Wendy Rosamond>Maybe in person,
because we're going to be OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3151-1
00:23:35.399 --> 00:23:42.926
<v Wendy Rosamond>This is another aspect. In May,
we're going to have what we're calling a</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3151-2
00:23:42.926 --> 00:23:46.432
<v Wendy Rosamond>sample rodeo. So we're organizing.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3179-0
00:23:46.952 --> 00:23:50.554
<v Wendy Rosamond>For all different types of furniture
samples,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3179-1
00:23:50.554 --> 00:23:54.078
<v Wendy Rosamond>these these classrooms will be part of
that,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3179-2
00:23:54.078 --> 00:24:00.265
<v Wendy Rosamond>but all different types of of furniture
like all different like lounge pieces,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3179-3
00:24:00.265 --> 00:24:01.752
<v Wendy Rosamond>different types of.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3207-0
00:24:01.872 --> 00:24:05.426
<v Wendy Rosamond>Desks that aren't related to the
classrooms,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3207-1
00:24:05.426 --> 00:24:11.744
<v Wendy Rosamond>we're going to bring that all to Midland
and we're going to hopefully make it a</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3207-2
00:24:11.744 --> 00:24:15.535
<v Wendy Rosamond>more,
we'll have a more public space so we will</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3207-3
00:24:15.535 --> 00:24:17.272
<v Wendy Rosamond>have some opportunity.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3208-0
00:24:17.392 --> 00:24:17.792
<v Wendy Rosamond>To.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3246-0
00:24:19.352 --> 00:24:26.246
<v Wendy Rosamond>Provide some interaction with, you know,
giving feedback on even those pieces,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3246-1
00:24:26.246 --> 00:24:32.441
<v Wendy Rosamond>but you know and that we have on sample.
So us having results of this,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3228-0
00:24:28.392 --> 00:24:28.992
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3246-2
00:24:32.441 --> 00:24:39.072
<v Wendy Rosamond>we will probably do another Mentimeter
based off of how successful this is.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3248-0
00:24:39.272 --> 00:24:41.592
<v Wendy Rosamond>With the sample rodeo.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3257-0
00:24:44.832 --> 00:24:47.352
<v Alex Wickes>OK, will we?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3286-0
00:24:45.632 --> 00:24:52.861
<v Wendy Rosamond>So I don't know what I don't really have.
That's not a real answer,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3286-1
00:24:52.861 --> 00:25:01.898
<v Wendy Rosamond>but is there an opportunity for us to and
and it might not even be at that location,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3286-2
00:25:01.898 --> 00:25:05.512
<v Wendy Rosamond>but we probably will have another.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3290-0
00:25:05.592 --> 00:25:10.472
<v Wendy Rosamond>Another opportunity to do another another
survey. Um.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3291-0
00:25:09.752 --> 00:25:10.232
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3293-0
00:25:12.472 --> 00:25:13.352
<v Wendy Rosamond>I don't know.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3297-0
00:25:14.032 --> 00:25:15.872
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah, no, I think that can work.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3299-0
00:25:16.912 --> 00:25:17.152
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3329-0
00:25:18.552 --> 00:25:23.867
<v Wendy Rosamond>I just don't know if if I if we need
anybody to interact with it and I'm not</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3329-1
00:25:23.867 --> 00:25:27.595
<v Wendy Rosamond>sure what they would do with it. Do you,
for example,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3329-2
00:25:27.595 --> 00:25:29.872
<v Wendy Rosamond>how how have you seen it be used?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3331-0
00:25:31.712 --> 00:25:32.992
<v Wendy Rosamond>With the interaction.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3379-0
00:25:35.472 --> 00:25:39.999
<v Alex Wickes>I think the the only one for this would
be like if someone could like click on</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3379-1
00:25:39.999 --> 00:25:44.411
<v Alex Wickes>something and read more. You know,
I hadn't thought about like if you wanted</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3379-2
00:25:44.411 --> 00:25:49.281
<v Alex Wickes>them to be able to like leave feedback on
it, you know, like do you agree with this?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3379-3
00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:52.432
<v Alex Wickes>Yes or no? Click a thumbs up.
It clicks a thumbs down.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3374-0
00:25:51.992 --> 00:25:52.832
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah, yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3413-0
00:25:52.752 --> 00:25:57.172
<v Alex Wickes>Because then you we could put up like the
four different chairs onto this thing and</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3413-1
00:25:57.172 --> 00:26:01.382
<v Alex Wickes>then you could read what people said
about it. And then it's like, what's your,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3413-2
00:26:01.382 --> 00:26:05.117
<v Alex Wickes>what's your aesthetical perception on
this? Like thumb up, thumb down.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3413-3
00:26:05.117 --> 00:26:08.432
<v Alex Wickes>You could get the answer that you don't
want, which is always.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3410-0
00:26:08.112 --> 00:26:08.352
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3455-0
00:26:08.512 --> 00:26:12.541
<v Alex Wickes>A a possibility. But yeah, I don't know,
just thinking of different,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3455-1
00:26:12.541 --> 00:26:16.745
<v Alex Wickes>different ways to to kind of like,
I don't know if it's a platform that</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3455-2
00:26:16.745 --> 00:26:20.774
<v Alex Wickes>you're building that isn't, you know,
restricted by your traditional</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3455-3
00:26:20.774 --> 00:26:25.387
<v Alex Wickes>limitations. Like what what what are you,
what would you always want it to do,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3455-4
00:26:25.387 --> 00:26:25.912
<v Alex Wickes>you know?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3475-0
00:26:26.272 --> 00:26:31.906
<v Alex Wickes>And like what would be the what would be
the dream for it and go and tackle that.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3452-0
00:26:26.512 --> 00:26:27.152
<v Wendy Rosamond>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3475-1
00:26:31.906 --> 00:26:37.539
<v Alex Wickes>But I could definitely starting with the
data export and then be able to clean it</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3475-2
00:26:37.539 --> 00:26:38.432
<v Alex Wickes>up, get some.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3494-0
00:26:39.392 --> 00:26:44.307
<v Alex Wickes>Key themes out of it and uh some basic
responses and then be able to put that up</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3494-1
00:26:44.307 --> 00:26:47.645
<v Alex Wickes>on the the site tour.
It can be nice and graphical and</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3494-2
00:26:47.645 --> 00:26:48.312
<v Alex Wickes>everything.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3498-0
00:26:49.272 --> 00:26:50.032
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah, yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3499-0
00:26:49.872 --> 00:26:51.232
<v Alex Wickes>We can, we can shoot for it.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3545-0
00:26:52.512 --> 00:26:56.335
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah,
cause what's gonna happen is and I don't</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3545-1
00:26:56.335 --> 00:27:00.726
<v Wendy Rosamond>really and Casey probably would know more
about that.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3545-2
00:27:00.726 --> 00:27:07.395
<v Wendy Rosamond>But the the process of this is is could
be a little different than the process of</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3545-3
00:27:07.395 --> 00:27:12.112
<v Wendy Rosamond>like the overall building design process.
This is a much.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3576-0
00:27:12.352 --> 00:27:17.910
<v Wendy Rosamond>Smaller group that is part of the
committee, but the committee,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3576-1
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:24.162
<v Wendy Rosamond>this would really help the committee.
So I'm thinking out loud and this</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3576-2
00:27:24.162 --> 00:27:29.632
<v Wendy Rosamond>document could be really insightful to
have their interaction.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3610-0
00:27:29.832 --> 00:27:33.832
<v Wendy Rosamond>With do you agree,
you know like the positive negatives and</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3580-0
00:27:31.592 --> 00:27:32.112
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3610-1
00:27:33.832 --> 00:27:39.232
<v Wendy Rosamond>their comments because it would only be
within the furniture committee who would</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3610-2
00:27:39.232 --> 00:27:44.232
<v Wendy Rosamond>participate in this and that's a smaller
group than you know, campus wide.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3605-0
00:27:44.152 --> 00:27:44.712
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3618-0
00:27:44.952 --> 00:27:49.152
<v Wendy Rosamond>So I I could see a benefit to that for
sure.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3654-0
00:27:49.832 --> 00:27:52.261
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah,
you'd be way more like surgical on like</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3654-1
00:27:52.261 --> 00:27:56.590
<v Alex Wickes>the responses that you're getting where
it's not just like Timmy doesn't like it,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3631-0
00:27:53.592 --> 00:27:54.112
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3654-2
00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:00.232
<v Alex Wickes>but it's like someone who I guess is
almost like the decision maker.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3666-0
00:27:59.992 --> 00:28:03.943
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah, they're the educators.
They're the ones who are in the middle</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3666-1
00:28:03.943 --> 00:28:07.952
<v Wendy Rosamond>and in the meetings who are making those
decisions with us. So yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3665-0
00:28:06.952 --> 00:28:07.112
<v Alex Wickes>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3671-0
00:28:12.352 --> 00:28:16.392
<v Wendy Rosamond>That's a great idea, actually.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3714-0
00:28:16.912 --> 00:28:21.367
<v Alex Wickes>I think that the biggest component about
all of this is you being able to this is</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3714-1
00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:25.496
<v Alex Wickes>something we were talking with Liberty
Hill about with this whole like cost</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3714-2
00:28:25.496 --> 00:28:29.679
<v Alex Wickes>estimating thing and This is what I so I
told Dustin I was like in this this</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3714-3
00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:31.472
<v Alex Wickes>platform it doesn't just let you.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3771-0
00:28:32.112 --> 00:28:36.067
<v Alex Wickes>Like, do what you're wanting to do,
but it lets you show people that you're</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3771-1
00:28:36.067 --> 00:28:38.512
<v Alex Wickes>doing what they're asking you to do,
you know?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3771-2
00:28:38.512 --> 00:28:42.259
<v Alex Wickes>So it's like when when all of the
teachers and the students are talking</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3729-0
00:28:39.872 --> 00:28:40.152
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3771-3
00:28:42.259 --> 00:28:44.652
<v Alex Wickes>about like, wow,
we really want bigger desks,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3771-4
00:28:44.652 --> 00:28:48.763
<v Alex Wickes>it's like you can put it out there and
say this is literally what you all were</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3771-5
00:28:48.763 --> 00:28:50.792
<v Alex Wickes>asking for. It's like we're not making.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3822-0
00:28:51.992 --> 00:28:54.934
<v Alex Wickes>This like estranged arbitrary decision.
It's like putting it,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3822-1
00:28:54.934 --> 00:28:58.682
<v Alex Wickes>really putting the power back in all of
the people who are who are going to be</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3822-2
00:28:58.682 --> 00:29:01.909
<v Alex Wickes>using this stuff, right.
And it's like all the teachers. It's like,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3792-0
00:29:00.192 --> 00:29:00.792
<v Wendy Rosamond>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3822-3
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:04.708
<v Alex Wickes>well, what are you,
what are you really wanting? You know,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3822-4
00:29:04.708 --> 00:29:08.361
<v Alex Wickes>it's like we we want to give you that.
And here's the platform that lets you</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3822-5
00:29:08.361 --> 00:29:09.832
<v Alex Wickes>directly tell us what you want.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3860-0
00:29:10.192 --> 00:29:16.818
<v Wendy Rosamond>And that you know that that in itself is
great because the people on the committee</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3826-0
00:29:10.672 --> 00:29:11.672
<v Alex Wickes>And it's like.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3860-1
00:29:16.818 --> 00:29:21.048
<v Wendy Rosamond>are not the people that participated in
this survey.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3842-0
00:29:19.592 --> 00:29:20.712
<v Alex Wickes>Yep, Yep.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3860-2
00:29:21.048 --> 00:29:27.114
<v Wendy Rosamond>So they need to be informed with what was
said and the process of this. So,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3860-3
00:29:27.114 --> 00:29:28.072
<v Wendy Rosamond>so the idea.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3898-0
00:29:28.632 --> 00:29:33.739
<v Wendy Rosamond>Because this will be presented to the
committee and I would assume also to the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3898-1
00:29:33.739 --> 00:29:37.036
<v Wendy Rosamond>Superintendent.
But the whole idea is that that we</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3898-2
00:29:37.036 --> 00:29:42.077
<v Wendy Rosamond>because we have taken them the committee
through this process of this is what</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3898-3
00:29:42.077 --> 00:29:44.792
<v Wendy Rosamond>we're doing, these are the, these are the.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3923-0
00:29:44.872 --> 00:29:50.696
<v Wendy Rosamond>We want to take them to each campus.
You decide the teacher,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3923-1
00:29:50.696 --> 00:29:56.043
<v Wendy Rosamond>you decide which classroom.
And then we have, you know,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3923-2
00:29:56.043 --> 00:30:00.912
<v Wendy Rosamond>performed one semester of this survey and
we have.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3937-0
00:30:01.272 --> 00:30:06.413
<v Wendy Rosamond>The the fall semester results and this is
what we're going to talk about and that's</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3937-1
00:30:06.413 --> 00:30:09.472
<v Wendy Rosamond>how we're going to present this to the
committee.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3945-0
00:30:10.992 --> 00:30:12.929
<v Alex Wickes>There you go. Well,
you'll be able to give them,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3945-1
00:30:12.929 --> 00:30:14.272
<v Alex Wickes>give them the data that they need.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3950-0
00:30:15.072 --> 00:30:16.632
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah, it'd be really awesome.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3971-0

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/3977-0
00:30:25.152 --> 00:30:27.112
<v Alex Wickes>That need to be known about.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4023-0

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4023-3
00:30:37.616 --> 00:30:40.797
<v Wendy Rosamond>this is what we're doing,
even if it's a visual,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4007-0

<v Wendy Rosamond>this is what we're doing,

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4043-0

<v Alex Wickes>Yeah, but this is gonna be.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4346-0
00:34:05.312 --> 00:34:09.282
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah, we could do that, yeah.
And then I guess so for the overview,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4346-1
00:34:09.282 --> 00:34:13.602
<v Alex Wickes>we've been then me just kinda like
reviewing the findings that it came up</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4346-2
00:34:13.602 --> 00:34:16.346
<v Alex Wickes>with,
seeing like where it needs to adjust and</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4346-3
00:34:16.346 --> 00:34:20.724
<v Alex Wickes>then be able to put that in some basic
graphics and everything for to help</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4346-4
00:34:20.724 --> 00:34:22.592
<v Alex Wickes>visualize the different answers.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4345-0
00:34:24.752 --> 00:34:24.912
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4354-0
00:34:27.112 --> 00:34:29.632
<v Wendy Rosamond>Sounds awesome. Yeah, this is exciting.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4350-0
00:34:27.272 --> 00:34:28.432
<v Alex Wickes>Cool beans.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4368-0
00:34:30.512 --> 00:34:33.205
<v Alex Wickes>It's being able to to bridge that gap,
man.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4368-1
00:34:33.205 --> 00:34:36.632
<v Alex Wickes>It's like it's all of the because we have
so much data.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4371-0
00:34:37.352 --> 00:34:37.712
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4379-0
00:34:37.792 --> 00:34:41.642
<v Alex Wickes>We have so much,
we just don't have the capacity to do</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4379-1
00:34:41.642 --> 00:34:42.832
<v Alex Wickes>anything with it.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4417-0
00:34:43.192 --> 00:34:46.572
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah,
and and I really unfortunately that the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4417-1
00:34:46.572 --> 00:34:49.878
<v Wendy Rosamond>Mentimeter,
there's positives and negatives,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4417-2
00:34:49.878 --> 00:34:55.168
<v Wendy Rosamond>but the big negative is that I can't tie
the answer to the next answer,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4417-3
00:34:55.168 --> 00:35:00.752
<v Wendy Rosamond>the second answer, the follow-up answer.
You know, I I can't tie that that.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4442-0
00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:07.532
<v Wendy Rosamond>Person's answer to like the it's too big.
What's too big? Which one?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4442-1
00:35:07.532 --> 00:35:14.544
<v Wendy Rosamond>Who answered that? Who had that question?
Who liked that table? Who? You know it.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4437-0
00:35:11.912 --> 00:35:12.152
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah.</v>

00:35:14.544 --> 00:35:15.912
<v Wendy Rosamond>I can't do that.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4443-0
00:35:16.032 --> 00:35:16.072
<v Wendy Rosamond>Oh.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4468-0
00:35:17.352 --> 00:35:24.468
<v Wendy Rosamond>But I mean in this particular situation,
it's not essential that I know I have</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4468-1
00:35:24.468 --> 00:35:29.872
<v Wendy Rosamond>that connection.
I think our our answers are going to help.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4510-0
00:35:30.752 --> 00:35:33.993
<v Wendy Rosamond>Define what we need out of a out of a
desk.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4510-1
00:35:33.993 --> 00:35:38.485
<v Wendy Rosamond>That's really like we're going to look at
like holistically,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4475-0
00:35:34.352 --> 00:35:34.632

00:35:38.485 --> 00:35:43.345
<v Wendy Rosamond>what do we need out of this desk?
We need it to be larger, right?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4491-0
00:35:39.712 --> 00:35:42.232
<v Alex Wickes>Yep. What does it need to be?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4510-3
00:35:43.345 --> 00:35:48.869
<v Wendy Rosamond>Two casters, dark top, you know,
that kind of stuff with the with the hook</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4510-4
00:35:48.869 --> 00:35:49.752
<v Wendy Rosamond>on the side.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4537-0
00:35:50.312 --> 00:35:55.015
<v Wendy Rosamond>For backpacks and then we're done.
And so then we've got our standard for a</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4537-1
00:35:55.015 --> 00:35:59.656
<v Wendy Rosamond>desk and then the same thing with the
chair. It's it's not rocket science,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4537-2
00:35:59.656 --> 00:36:01.512

00:36:03.032 --> 00:36:06.643
<v Wendy Rosamond>You know a building and and you know it
is.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4549-1
00:36:06.643 --> 00:36:10.992
<v Wendy Rosamond>It is simple enough that we can manage
what we have.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4558-0

00:37:00.672 --> 00:37:05.817
<v Alex Wickes>It looks like all the questions are
stored as columns and the responses are</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4638-1
00:37:05.817 --> 00:37:06.832
<v Alex Wickes>stored as rows.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4642-0

00:37:24.512 --> 00:37:27.432
<v Alex Wickes>All the dates these are the applicant
number.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4658-0
00:37:29.032 --> 00:37:30.792

00:37:49.752 --> 00:37:56.112
<v Wendy Rosamond>Like that's from the that one person who
answered all of the questions.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4681-0
00:37:52.192 --> 00:37:53.112
<v Alex Wickes>The one person.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4693-0
00:37:57.152 --> 00:37:59.952
<v Alex Wickes>Think so? I mean,
is this the order of questions?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4698-0
00:38:04.072 --> 00:38:08.392
<v Wendy Rosamond>Uh, the the question, which? Yeah, um.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4701-0
00:38:10.032 --> 00:38:10.112
<v Wendy Rosamond>Um.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4704-0
00:38:11.632 --> 00:38:12.992
<v Alex Wickes>It looks like a lot of them are blank.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4745-0
00:38:13.672 --> 00:38:17.138
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah,
I because those are the same questions.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4745-1
00:38:17.138 --> 00:38:22.788
<v Wendy Rosamond>Piece of furniture caught your eye first.
That's that's the same question.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4731-0
00:38:22.552 --> 00:38:23.672
<v Alex Wickes>089.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4745-2
00:38:22.788 --> 00:38:27.158
<v Wendy Rosamond>So it's not then. Yeah, yeah,
those aren't the questions.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4745-3
00:38:27.158 --> 00:38:29.192
<v Wendy Rosamond>That was like one question.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4747-0
00:38:29.432 --> 00:38:31.472
<v Wendy Rosamond>Which is your favorite chair?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4744-0
00:38:29.592 --> 00:38:30.232
<v Alex Wickes>'Cause it looks like.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4748-0
00:38:32.672 --> 00:38:33.312
<v Alex Wickes>No.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4754-0
00:38:34.232 --> 00:38:37.152
<v Wendy Rosamond>And then why?
Why is it your favorite chair?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4772-0
00:38:40.712 --> 00:38:46.110
<v Wendy Rosamond>And then how comfortable is your favorite
chair? Very comfortable entire class.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4772-1
00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.392
<v Wendy Rosamond>So the question is.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4781-0
00:38:47.712 --> 00:38:51.472
<v Alex Wickes>I think these are the students's answers
'cause this guy's all in Spanish.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4791-0
00:38:50.792 --> 00:38:55.488
<v Wendy Rosamond>Same, same. Oh my gosh.
Well then we're automatically getting</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4791-1
00:38:55.488 --> 00:38:56.472
<v Wendy Rosamond>what we need.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4810-0
00:38:56.912 --> 00:38:59.390
<v Alex Wickes>Yes,
I can cross reference between like</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/4819-0

00:42:05.312 --> 00:42:10.104

<v Alex Wickes>'cause like these guys.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5334-0
00:43:43.272 --> 00:43:47.312
<v Alex Wickes>Tested all tables? Yes.
Which is your favorite desk? Desk one.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5335-0
00:43:47.552 --> 00:43:47.832
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5375-0
00:43:49.712 --> 00:43:53.637
<v Wendy Rosamond>And and honestly,
what we would do is the ones that say no,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5339-0
00:43:49.832 --> 00:43:50.072
<v Alex Wickes>Why?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5375-1
00:43:53.637 --> 00:43:58.544
<v Wendy Rosamond>have you tested all 4 tables? No,
for that following answer is really moot</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5375-2
00:43:58.544 --> 00:44:02.272
<v Wendy Rosamond>because it really doesn't help us if you
haven't tested.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5390-0
00:44:01.832 --> 00:44:04.960
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah, but then why did you?
Why did you only test the one?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5377-0
00:44:03.512 --> 00:44:03.592
<v Wendy Rosamond>So.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5390-1
00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:08.352
<v Alex Wickes>And they're like, well, it was the most.
It looked the coolest.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5386-0
00:44:07.432 --> 00:44:07.592
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5439-0
00:44:08.432 --> 00:44:12.696
<v Wendy Rosamond>It's it's it was my,
it was my and a lot of them, you know,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5439-1
00:44:12.696 --> 00:44:17.599
<v Wendy Rosamond>just pick their desk and stay at their
desk. They don't venture out.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5439-2
00:44:17.599 --> 00:44:22.147
<v Wendy Rosamond>And if that's the case,
then the feedback that we get is not as</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5439-3
00:44:22.147 --> 00:44:27.832
<v Wendy Rosamond>helpful unless you you really do have
answers with the people who who did test.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5441-0
00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:31.232
<v Wendy Rosamond>It's all for because they have a a better
opinion.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5442-0
00:44:31.312 --> 00:44:31.952
<v Alex Wickes>Mhm.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5447-0
00:44:33.552 --> 00:44:36.912
<v Wendy Rosamond>Or a more informed opinion. I'll say that.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5453-0
00:44:47.312 --> 00:44:51.192
<v Alex Wickes>Mm-hmm. It's a nice upgrade.
I can focus better.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5470-0
00:44:50.672 --> 00:44:57.592
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah, I mean, that's a direct.
That's really awesome. Oh my gosh.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5476-0
00:44:55.432 --> 00:44:58.415
<v Alex Wickes>Yep, it's a it's a nice grade.
I like the look,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5476-1
00:44:58.415 --> 00:45:01.832
<v Alex Wickes>the new look of it and then you can come
and see like.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5485-0
00:45:03.032 --> 00:45:05.360
<v Alex Wickes>Oh,
it made the desks look like they're more</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5485-1
00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.912
<v Alex Wickes>LED drawn to in a cool design.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5486-0
00:45:09.192 --> 00:45:09.312
<v Wendy Rosamond>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5494-0
00:45:11.272 --> 00:45:14.467
<v Alex Wickes>Yes, it's awesome.
They put wheels in chairs. Wheels.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5494-1
00:45:14.467 --> 00:45:15.472
<v Alex Wickes>Wheels look cool.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5507-0
00:45:16.832 --> 00:45:20.992
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK, that that changed everything.
Oh my gosh, I'm so happy.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5501-0
00:45:17.632 --> 00:45:19.512
<v Alex Wickes>Wheels look cool.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5521-0
00:45:22.952 --> 00:45:27.298
<v Alex Wickes>OK, I'll, I'll report back. We'll see.

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5521-1
00:45:27.298 --> 00:45:28.792
<v Alex Wickes>This is gonna go cool.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5553-0
00:45:27.312 --> 00:45:30.269
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK,
this is going to be so awesome and</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5553-1
00:45:30.269 --> 00:45:35.956
<v Wendy Rosamond>getting our visuals together and I'll
I'll send you the link to all of the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5553-2
00:45:35.956 --> 00:45:41.112
<v Wendy Rosamond>images that I had in the survey so you
have access to that as well.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5543-0
00:45:39.352 --> 00:45:39.792
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5575-0
00:45:41.712 --> 00:45:44.805
<v Alex Wickes>Will those be organized by like question
number?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5575-1
00:45:44.805 --> 00:45:49.792
<v Alex Wickes>This is what chair one is or is it titled
by like Herman Miller like you like?</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5603-0
00:45:47.712 --> 00:45:51.490
<v Wendy Rosamond>No, it's in. It's.
I didn't put any names on it in the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5603-1
00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:56.778
<v Wendy Rosamond>survey because they really don't need to
know. It was really just chair one,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5603-2
00:45:56.778 --> 00:46:01.722
<v Wendy Rosamond>chair two, chair three, chair 4,
because I didn't want to complicate it</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5603-3
00:46:01.722 --> 00:46:02.752
<v Wendy Rosamond>for the survey.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5612-0
00:46:02.432 --> 00:46:05.947
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah,
you don't want to have anybody to like</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5636-0
00:46:03.152 --> 00:46:07.722
<v Wendy Rosamond>But that's right.
I I mean that don't don't get hung up on</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5612-1
00:46:05.947 --> 00:46:07.352
<v Alex Wickes>have preconceived.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5636-1
00:46:07.722 --> 00:46:12.525
<v Wendy Rosamond>on a manufacturer name.
I don't remember if I put that in the</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5636-2
00:46:12.525 --> 00:46:17.792
<v Wendy Rosamond>actual JPEG because they were all in
JPEGs. I'll look at that, but.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5641-0
00:46:18.352 --> 00:46:22.627
<v Wendy Rosamond>Um.
I think it's under the pilot classrooms.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5641-1
00:46:22.627 --> 00:46:22.912
<v Wendy Rosamond>Um.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5683-0
00:46:26.112 --> 00:46:31.769
<v Wendy Rosamond>Surveys. Resources. OK, let's see. Images.
OK, I OK, yes.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5683-1
00:46:31.769 --> 00:46:37.133
<v Wendy Rosamond>So what I have them tagged as is chair
one, chair two,</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5683-2
00:46:37.133 --> 00:46:45.032
<v Wendy Rosamond>chair three does have the manufacturer,
but I didn't put that in the survey, so.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5693-0
00:46:45.792 --> 00:46:53.232
<v Wendy Rosamond>The image is tied to the manufacturer so
that we actually have access to it, but.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5692-0
00:46:50.552 --> 00:46:50.992
<v Alex Wickes>Yeah.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5704-0
00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:59.717
<v Alex Wickes>OK, cool beans. Well,
I we got a lot of data.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5704-1
00:46:59.717 --> 00:47:01.632
<v Alex Wickes>We'll start crunching.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5706-0
00:47:02.432 --> 00:47:04.192
<v Wendy Rosamond>OK, sounds awesome.</v>

e1de36cb-617e-43b3-9268-758056c64b01/5711-0
00:47:04.272 --> 00:47:06.832
<v Alex Wickes>All right, Wendy,
