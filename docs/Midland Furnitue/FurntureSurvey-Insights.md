# Midland Furniture Pilot Survey Analysis

## Executive Summary (Meeting 2/3)

**321 students and 7 teachers** surveyed across 4 campuses. **93% positive first impressions.**

> **DATA NOTE:** The teacher survey had a typo - "Desk 4" was listed as "Desk 3" twice. This has been corrected in the source data, but the statistics below have not yet been updated. All statistics need to be re-verified before final presentation.

### Winners
- **Chair 3** (46.6%) and **Desk 3** (52.7%) are the clear student favorites
- But Chair 3 has the **lowest comfort rating** (90%) of all chairs - students pick it for SIZE, not comfort

### Why Chair 3 Wins
Students choose Chair 3 because it's **big, wide, and spacious** (29% mention this), not because it's the most comfortable. Chair 1 actually has the highest comfort rating (96.4%).

### Each Chair Has a Unique Appeal
| Chair | Why Students Pick It | Key Quote |
|-------|---------------------|-----------|
| Chair 1 | Hook for backpacks (20%) | "you can hang stuff on it without it tipping over" |
| Chair 2 | No hole in seat (11%) | "doesn't have a hole in the bottom" |
| **Chair 3** | Big/spacious (29%) | "wide and also big for a person" |
| Chair 4 | Lightweight/mobile (13%) | "I like being able to move my chair" |

### Top Desk Complaints
1. **Size** (25%) - "they need to be bigger"
2. **Mobility/Casters** (25%) - either moves too much or not enough
3. **Height** (8%) - "too tall for short people"
4. **Surface Transfer** (2%) - pencil marks showing through

### Teacher vs Student Alignment
- **Both agree:** Surface transfer is a problem, some desks too big
- **Key difference:** Teachers prefer **2 casters** (not 4), and **teachers do most rearranging** (4 of 5)
- **Implication:** Teacher preferences on mobility should take priority

### Design Recommendations
1. **Size matters most** - 45% of students prioritize workspace size
2. **2 casters preferred** - middle ground between mobile and stable (per teachers)
3. **Consider height adjustability** - 10% of students mention height issues
4. **Darker/more durable laminate** - reduce pencil transfer marks
5. **Keep the hook** - Chair 1's backpack hook is valued by 20% of its fans

### Student Personas
- **Space-Seeking Sam** (45%) - wants bigger furniture
- **Mobile Max** (30%) - wants movement but with locking wheels
- **Height-Conscious Hannah** (10%) - needs adjustable heights

### Chair Comfort Ratings (By Chair)

| Chair | Popularity | % Comfortable | Can Sit Most/All |
|-------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Chair 1 | 20.1% | **96.4%** | 91.1% |
| Chair 2 | 16.1% | 93.3% | **97.8%** |
| **Chair 3** | **46.6%** | 90.0% | 89.2% |
| Chair 4 | 17.2% | 93.8% | 87.5% |

**Key insight: Chair 3 is most popular but has the lowest comfort rating.** Students are choosing it for other reasons (size, not connected to desk, spacious) rather than pure comfort. This suggests factors beyond comfort are driving preference.

Overall across all chairs: 92.5% comfortable, 90.7% can sit most/all of class.

### What Makes Each Chair Unique

| Chair | Differentiator | % Mentioning | Key Quote |
|-------|----------------|--------------|-----------|

| **Chair 2** | No hole in seat | 11% | "it doesn't have a hole in the bottom" |
| **Chair 3** | Big/Wide/Spacious | 29% | "because it is wide and also big for a person" |
| **Chair 4** | Lightweight/mobile | 13% | "I like being able to move my chair and not having it stuck" |

**Chair 3 wins because it's the biggest/widest**, not because it's the most comfortable. Students with larger bodies or who want more personal space gravitate to it.

**Chair 1's hook** is a unique feature - 20% of Chair 1 fans mention being able to hang backpacks.

**Chair 2's "no hole"** - multiple students specifically mention they don't like the gap/hole in other chair seats ("so my ahh is showing").

## Additional Findings (To Investigate)

### Open Questions

- **Good vs Bad?** - Some comments need deeper investigation to determine if they're positive or negative feedback
- **Hooks** - Need to probe deeper into hook preferences
- **Armrests** - There will be no armrests on the chairs (design decision)

### Classroom Size Context

Desk size complaints may not be an issue. Some teachers may be coming from larger or smaller classrooms.

**Suggestion for Furniture Rodeo:** Tape out the area of the new classrooms so teachers can see the accurate size in context with the furniture options.

### Unsolicited Topics Mentioned

| Topic | Mentions | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Leg room | 42 | Knees hitting desk, leg space |
| Footrest/bar | 34 | "add foot rest", "bar in the middle is terrible" |

## Teacher Furniture: Desk vs Mobile Table

Teachers were asked about two separate pieces:
1. **Teacher Desk** - Main/stationary workstation
2. **Mobile Table** - Movable piece for teaching

---

### Teacher Desk (Main/Stationary)

| Teacher | Enough Space? | Redesign Wish |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| T2 | Yes | Want height adjustable |
| T3 | Yes | Shelves connected, pencil drawer |
| T5 | Yes | Slightly bigger |
| T6 | Yes | Nothing |
| T7 | No | Bigger - no space with desktop computer |

---

### Mobile Table (Movable Piece)

| Teacher | How They Use It |
|---------|-----------------|
| T2 | "At the front for now" - not moving it (assembly issues, missing screws) |
| T3 | "Very bulky - use it in back to teach behind students" |
| T5 | "As a podium and movable group desk" - loves it |
| T6 | Moves around while teaching - laptop, materials, supplies |
| T7 | "Mostly fixed to one spot" - but likes flexibility for hallway use |

---

### Key Finding: Mobile Table Usage Varies

Teachers use the mobile table very differently:

| Usage Pattern | Teachers | Description |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Active teaching tool | T5, T6 | Move it around, use as podium |
| Fixed station | T7 | Stays put, occasionally moved |
| Bulky/problematic | T2, T3 | Hard to maneuver, assembly issues |

> "It's very bulky... Smaller bottom piece to make it easier to maneuver" (T3)

**Bottom line:** The mobile table works great for some teachers (dynamic teaching tool) but is too bulky for others. Consider a lighter/smaller option.
