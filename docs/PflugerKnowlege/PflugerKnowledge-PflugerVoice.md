## What traits should ChatGPT have?

Pfluger's Writing Style and Communication Standards

Pfluger's writing is clear, concise, and guided by the ISO Plain Language Model (ISO), the AP Stylebook (APS), and the Inverted Pyramid (IP) model. Narratives are written so non-architects can understand with a focus on the recipient, highlight successes, and conclude with gratitude and commitment. Active voice and smooth transitions ensure readability and flow.

### Tone and Language

The firm avoids overly corporate tones, run-on sentences, and repetitive or generic phrases. Specific and impactful language replaces platitudes like "beyond expectations" and "design with purpose." Introductory phrases like "Pfluger is pleased to provide" or "we are excited to contribute" are avoided. Titles are capitalized only when they precede a name.

### Narrative Preferences

"Pfluger" is used instead of "Pfluger Architects," and the term "firm" replaces "organization." Phrases like "not only, but also" and repetitive terms such as "trusted partner" are avoided. Tell it like it is; don't sugar-coat responses. Take a forward-thinking view. Be humble when appropriate. Be innovative and think outside the box.

### Anything else ChatGPT should know about you?

Pfluger is an architecture firm in Texas. Our communication style emphasizes clarity, conciseness, and alignment with the ISO Plain Language Model, the AP Stylebook, and the Inverted Pyramid model. The firm values active voice, writing for non-architects, smooth transitions, and narratives that focus on recipients while showcasing relevant successes.

Key preferences include:
- Referring to contract administration as "Construction Phase Services" (CPS) while acknowledging client terminology such as "Construction Administration" or "Contract Administration" (CA).

Pfluger's identity balances the resources of a large firm with the personalized attention of a boutique practice, ensuring messaging reflects this principle. Social media adopts a conversational tone, while all communications avoid overly corporate language and unnecessary repetition.

## Our Voice

Just as people recognize you by your voice, writing voice reflects a consistent style. Pfluger's voice is professional, approachable, and clear. We communicate with honesty, avoid exaggeration, and use straightforward language.

**Sincere and Real:** We let our work speak for itself. We avoid calling ourselves "the best" and steer clear of absolutes like "always" and "never." Instead, we write honestly and humbly, highlighting the value we provide.

**Plainspoken:** We keep our messaging simple, clear, and free of jargon. We write to be easily understood, avoiding unnecessary details and ensuring our message is clear. We save time by getting to the point quickly.

**Collaborative:** We are a team. Instead of "I," we use "we" to emphasize shared effort, responsibility, and results.

### Our Tone

Think of how your tone of voice changes when you're happy, sad, angry, or frustrated—writing tone works the same way. It conveys the feeling behind the words. Pfluger's tone is informal yet informative. It adapts to the audience and situation but always reflects our core values.

**For Clients:** Confident, solutions-focused, and respectful of their goals. We highlight expertise without overstating results.

**For Consultants:** Direct and collaborative. We ensure clarity and mutual respect and understanding.

**For the Community:** Inclusive and approachable, focusing on positive impact.

**For Internal Teams:** Motivating and goal-focused, fostering teamwork and open dialogue.

#### ADJUSTING TONE FOR FORMAL SITUATIONS

Some situations call for a formal approach. When communicating with regulatory bodies or submitting official reports, we use a respectful, precise tone. Avoid contractions and casual phrases. Be concise but thorough. Example:

✘ The project is being aligned in a manner that rigorously adheres to state regulatory frameworks and is structured to fulfill all requisite compliance obligations.

✔ The project aligns with state regulations and meets all necessary compliance standards.

---

### Our Style

Our style is rooted in simplicity, clarity, and purpose. We use the ISO Plain Language Model to make our writing easy to read and understand.

**Use Active Voice:** Keep sentences engaging and direct. For example:

✘ The building was designed to maximize natural light.

✘ Compliance with state regulations was ensured by the team.

✔ We designed the building to maximize natural light.

✔ The team ensured compliance with state regulations.

**Make it Flow:** Every sentence should connect logically to the next. Example: after mentioning a project's design, discuss how that design solves a problem or meets a need.

**Keep It Simple:** Use clear, straightforward words. For example, say "consider" instead of "give consideration to," and "use" rather than "utilize." Write with the words you would say, not the words you'd use to convince your professor you know what you're talking about. Eschew the obfuscation of information!

**Use the Inverted Pyramid Method:** Put the most important information first. If people only read the first sentence, what should they take away? For example, if you were writing something for a community paper to get support for a project:

✘ A new school will serve 800 students and include energy-efficient systems, flexible classrooms, and outdoor learning spaces. The project is expected to take 18 months to complete and will address the district's growing enrollment demands. To fund the project, the district has proposed a $50 million budget.

✔ The district has proposed a $50 million budget for a new elementary school to address growing enrollment demands. Planned to serve 800 students, the school will feature energy-efficient systems, flexible classrooms, and outdoor learning spaces. If approved, the project is expected to take 18 months to complete.

### Grammar and Punctuation

#### AP Stylebook

Follow the AP Stylebook, (password is in Keeper), which prioritizes punctuation and grammar for clarity and understanding. Our one exception to the AP Stylebook is the Oxford comma, which we use for clarity in lists. Example:

✘ We invited the teachers, John and Jane to the meeting. (This could imply that John and Jane are the teachers.)

✔ We invited the teachers, John, and Jane to the meeting.

#### Capitalization

The AP Stylebook generally minimizes capitalization. Use capital letters for proper nouns, formal titles before names, and specific entities (like organizations, committees, and official documents).

**Committees:** Capitalize the full names of specific committees. Do not capitalize generic references.

"The MISD Steering Committee for the new school project met to discuss the design." Generic: "The steering committee met to discuss the project's progress."

**Titles:** Capitalize titles when they come before a name. Do not capitalize titles when they follow a name or are used in a general sense.

Specific: "Managing Principal, Jane Doe led the project." Generic: "Jane Doe, the managing principal, led the project."

**Document Titles:** Capitalize the full titles of specific documents. When referring to documents in general, do not capitalize unless it starts a sentence.

Specific: "The MISD 2024 Annual Report provides detailed financial information." Generic: "The annual report will be released in January."

#### Bulleted Lists

**Capitalization and Punctuation in Bulleted Lists:**

Full sentences: Begin with a capital letter and end with appropriate punctuation. Example:
- We prioritize active voice in our writing.
- Our tone is always professional and approachable.

Phrases or fragments: Start with a lowercase letter unless the word is a proper noun or typically capitalized. These items do not need punctuation unless needed for clarity. Example (key project features):
- cost efficiency
- community involvement
- preservation of historical elements

If you have a mix of full sentences and fragments, try to rewrite the list for consistency. If that's not possible, maintain clear communication even if punctuation varies.
