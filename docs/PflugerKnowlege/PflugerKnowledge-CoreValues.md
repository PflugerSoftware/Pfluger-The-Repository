# Meaningful Human Experience

## Defined

### Introduction

We believe that whenever collaboration and problem-solving occur, the outcome should be a meaningful human experience (MHE). Our purpose is to inspire people to create a more meaningful human experience, starting with each of us. Whether it's for our clients, partners, or team members, understanding how to craft these experiences is important. Our work should create exceptional buildings and results for our clients while making the process inspiring.

**Producing a meaningful human experience consists of four essential components: structure, engagement, reflection, and discovery.**

## Components of a Meaningful Human Experience

Everyone, regardless of their role, can confidently and seamlessly experience an MHE. But how do you incorporate each of these into a process or a project? First, we must define what each one means to Pfluger.

• **Structure** – We develop an intentional framework that provides clarity and promotes a shared devotion to finding/creating/discovering something special.

• **Engagement** –We collaborate, inspire, and explore one another's ideas with a curious mindset and an elevated level of trust.

• **Reflection** – We step away to decompress and create opportunities to cultivate new perspectives.

• **Discovery** – We are curious problem seekers, continuously learning by asking probing questions, challenging assumptions, and exploring multiple perspectives to achieve innovative solutions.

## Implementing These Components

Now that we have defined the components, we need to understand how they can be integrated into our process and our projects. Here are some examples that demonstrate how you can integrate a MHE into your daily work:

### Structure

• **Meeting Design:** Design a meeting where participants understand the purpose, process, and payoff. Curate an agenda that includes opportunities for engagement, reflection and discovery. We have a database of multiple meeting designs used with clients to inspire them as we understand their vision and guiding principles.

• **Standardized Documents and Checklists:** Pfluger has a robust set of standards for our projects and has developed a checklist for each phase. These ensure firm-wide consistency and thoroughness, allowing us to leverage staff from multiple offices to contribute meaningfully to a project at any phase.

• **Workspace:** Our workspaces offer versatility through technology, furniture, and various room types. This structure allows us to focus on our creative work. Open areas encourage collaboration, movement, and expansive thinking. Smaller rooms provide spaces for quiet reflection.

### Engagement

• **Project Success**
    - a. External: Visioning Process: We are intentional about how we engage with each client during our visioning workshops to create a community of stakeholders deeply invested in the project's success. Our activities, while thought-provoking, future-focused, and collaborative, are customized to each client's needs and expectations. This community of stakeholders remains active in shaping the project's vision.
    - b. Internal: Pin-Ups: Our weekly pin-ups engage with all staff, regardless of role, to collaborate on a particular design challenge. These are not structured to be a report-out of a project but instead to encourage curiosity and problem-solving. By bringing together different perspectives, we expand the range of ideas and possibilities, creating the opportunity for both practical and innovative solutions.

• **Business Development:** We build our business by creating strong, trust-based client relationships. We do this by developing meaningful strategies to connect with key leaders. We attend board meetings to understand the dynamics of the organization and each member. We go on tours with key stakeholders to gather insight on likes and dislikes. We sit down with decision-makers to understand their challenges and demonstrate our commitment to help solve them. We stay in tune with our clients at regular intervals throughout all phases of our work by sharing a meal together and delivering face-to-face client satisfaction surveys.

### Reflection

• **Cognitive Breaks:** How often have you been sitting in traffic and suddenly thought of a way to solve that pesky problem eating at you? Stepping away from the problem and doing an unrelated task allows your mind to relax. Examples of these breaks include exercising, being in nature, driving without the "radio" on, refilling your coffee or tea, or even sleeping on it. Intentionally giving yourself time away will mitigate mental fatigue and foster creative thinking.
    - a. External: We do not want to do charrettes or stack meetings; need to build breaks between meetings to allow for everyone to decompress and reflect on the design

• **Internal Team Debrief:** Reflecting after a meeting or engagement on what the group liked, lacked, learned, and longed for creates an intentional reflection that makes our future work better. After a milestone project meeting, the PM, PA, and PD compare notes and discuss any action item that needs to be disseminated to the rest of the project team. This small group provides a chance to bounce ideas off each other and formulate a game plan for follow-up to-dos.

**Reflective Prompts:** Thoughtful questions can provoke thinking far beyond the moment and can 'stick with us' for days on end as we continue to process. Examples of reflective prompts are included below and are utilized in internal and external meetings.

Examples from a client visioning process:
- "If rooms are boxes, what would happen if the boxes were gone?"
- "In what unexpected places do we find educational settings?"

Examples from an internal leadership team retreat:
- Self-reflection: If we are to achieve our meeting goals, how must we show up for each other and ourselves?
    - o Reflect quietly on your own and share amongst the group, placing sticky notes on the wall to create commitments as a team.
- Self-reflection:
    - o What work should we eliminate that no longer serves our goals?
    - o What work could you delegate that would provide a learning opportunity for others on our team?

### Discovery

• **Workshops/Retreats:** We intentionally design sessions to provide moments of discovery among attendees. Through small group discussions with open-ended questions or creative tasks, participants are free to explore various possibilities.
    - **External:** Pfluger Architects' discovery process with Midland ISD high schools exemplifies our goal to inspire and create meaningful human experiences. We started with our Breaking of the Bread, sitting alongside district leadership, asking future-focused questions, and listening intently to form a collaborative team. Our process included an activity, Postcards from the Future, and a customized visioning game, Form + Function. These multi-dimensional activities helped stakeholders identify and reflect on key experiences they envision at the new campuses, leading to an understanding of the types of spaces that can be designed to support them.
    - **Internal:** At our 2024 shareholder retreat, we used several prompts to explore the possibility of a meaningful human experience. This exercise revealed that more work needed to be done. We took a cognitive break over dinner and reconvened as a smaller group to reflect and evaluate. This smaller group made several discoveries by challenging each other's ideas and working to find common ground.

• **Survey:** Using a survey can be a strategy for producing moments of discovery for the one surveying and the individuals being surveyed. Surveys can create moments of pause and reflection to gain critical insights that can help shape how best to engage a stakeholder group, tap into diverse perspectives, look for common themes, and so much more. Below are examples of how surveying has been used internally and externally to generate discovery.
    - **External:**
        - o Community Engagement -> Midland Survey
    - **Internal:**
        - § W.I.P.
            - o In June 2024, the Leadership Team was curious as to why architectural standards were not being utilized to create consistency and high-quality client deliverables. The Leadership Team had a variety of hypotheses on why standards were not being utilized, ranging from awareness to training to access to relevancy. To create a better understanding of the barriers and opportunities for improvement, a survey was utilized to tap into the perspective of those team members who would, in theory, be utilizing standards on a consistent basis.
            - o An example of that survey is located here for reference (link to be provided with final publication).

## Measuring the Meaningful Human Experience

Now that we have defined the components of a meaningful human experience, we need to understand how the experience is measured. We believe that if we design client and staff experiences to generate meaningful human experiences, the result is a number of Aha! Moments, pleasant and unexpected experiences, ideas, or breakthroughs. We aspire to create these Aha! Moments, planned and unplanned, in every structured opportunity involving collaboration and problem-solving. We prioritize quality over quantity, where a collective group experiences the same Aha!

• **Aha!** – When we create an Aha! Moment, our clients, team members, and/or partners have a pleasant and unexpected experience, idea, or breakthrough that comes from each of the components. We anticipate that every meaningful human experience will yield more than one Aha! during the overall process. We want everyone who engages with this process to have these enlightenments that inspire us to go above and beyond a simple task/assignment.

### Aha! Examples:

#### Midland ISD Payback Analysis

During our interview with Midland ISD, we noted that funds generated using bond proceeds can be used to reduce Maintenance & Operations costs, thereby allowing money to be redirected to the classroom. We suggested that IF this is important to the district, they could use bond proceeds or related interest earnings to purchase solar arrays on the new high schools that could greatly reduce or even eliminate the cost of energy for these schools to operate. This suggestion offered value that wasn't anticipated, which resulted in Pfluger developing a detailed payback analysis for the district's consideration.

#### Contract Administration Training

We believe that meaningful experiences include structure. The Contract Administration workshop in mid-spring of 2024 was a great example of this. We designed the workshop not just to share Pfluger Standards for executing contract administration but also to build stronger relationships between individuals in different offices. The goal was to foster a sense that we're all working together, even if we're not in the same place.

We kicked things off with an icebreaker that had nothing to do with contract administration but helped everyone loosen up and get to know each other better. This set a positive tone for the rest of the workshop. The presentations were the result of months of planning and collaboration. We worked through the details of each topic and developed a consensus among the most experienced and senior people from each office. By the time the presentations were happening, we were all on the same page.

We also included several open-ended topics to encourage conversation and brainstorming about possible improvements to our system. In between presentations, participants engaged in group work and breakout projects, which helped break up the monotony of sitting and listening to lectures.

While we didn't categorize all the "Aha!" moments during the workshop, one realization that slowly dawned on everyone during the planning and implementation was that we actually do have CA standards we can agree on across the firm. Initially, this seemed questionable since each office thought their way of doing things was slightly different from the others. Participants had opportunities to make better connections and learned that we have standards. They saw the effort and value provided.

### Measuring Aha!

• **External Measurement:**
    - o Incorporate how to measure Aha! into our current design process. (Working with Christian on this.)

• **Internal Measurement:**
    - o When we are working to deliver an MHE internally, integrate opportunities for team members to reflect on the Aha! Moments they had and share them with the team. Individuals responsible for managing the project and/or leading the initiative are responsible for bringing reflection and discussion to the group.
    - o All employees can reflect on Aha! Moments throughout their work and career at Pfluger. Everyone is encouraged to keep track of their Aha! Moments and share with their team lead/manager.

## Final Thoughts

A Meaningful Human Experience is personal. We cannot mass-produce an MHE, nor is that our goal. Instead, our job is to do our best to thoughtfully craft opportunities for people to experience their own meaning.
