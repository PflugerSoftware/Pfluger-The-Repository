## Project Standards - Charge Type: Overhead

### Admin Projects

These project types can only be created by the Finance team.

Overhead projects that appear continuously on timesheets (e.g., PTO, Business Development) are used by the system to code labor and require COO approval and direction prior to creation.

### Conference / Convention Projects

These project types can only be created by the Finance team.

Conferences/conventions for marketing purposes must list the CEO in the "Managing Principal / Client Executive" field on the Overview tab.

Conferences/conventions for learning and professional development must list the COO in the "Managing Principal / Client Executive" field on the Overview tab.

Until a dedicated Project Manager is identified, the Executive Assistant to the CEO/COO should be listed in the "Lead Project Manager" field on the Overview tab to manage and maintain the plan and resources.

### Indirect Projects

These project types can only be created by the Finance team.

A member of the Leadership Team must sponsor the project. This person will be listed in the "Managing Principal / Client Executive" field on the Overview tab.

A Pfluger employee must be identified to manage project labor. This individual will be listed in the "Lead Project Manager" field on the Overview tab and is responsible for planning and managing project resources.

---

### Project Numbering Convention

#### Admin

**OVH-XXXX**

OVH = Constant to designate overhead projects used by admins on the backend.

XXXX = Any characters to abbreviate the overhead project type.

Examples:
OVH-PTO1, OVH-BDHE
OVH-MAWD, OVH-TECH

#### Conference

**CON-XXXX**

CON = Constant to designate conference/convention projects.

XXXX = Any characters to abbreviate the conference.

Examples:
CON-A4LE
CON-TASB

#### Indirect Project

**XYY-XXXX**

X = Constant to designate indirect projects to track T&E.

YY = The last two digits of the year the project is first being tracked.

XXXX = Any characters to abbreviate the project.

Examples:
X24-RB12
X24-GDG1

---

## Project Standards - Charge Type: Regular

### Creation

These project types can be created by anyone.

Only Finance can make the "approved for use in processing." This typically happens when the project's stage is changed to either 11, 12, or 13. This and project status are what allows staff to bill time to projects.

### Naming Conventions

**"Short Name"**

Naming conventions are extremely important in our database. This allows consistency in reporting and systems that tie into this database. If you are unsure of how to name a project, contact Marketing.

This is the internal name that we use for all systems. Do not change this name.

Limit of 42 characters AVOID USE OF SPECIAL CHARACTERS like # and %

District (C)ISD – Abbreviated Description

Examples:
- Alamo ISD – HS3
- Lamar CISD – Wertheimer MS A&R

**"Long Name" (published project name)**

Formal name you use externally. For new schools, once the school is name change the long name to match the new school name. DO NOT CHANGE THE SHORT NAME.

**Phase and Task**

A significant amount of our reports are tied to the numbering and naming conventions that are set up in the "All Phases" Template project. It is extremely important to only use the phases and tasks established in that template. If you need to add a phase or task that does not exist in the template, please notify Finance.

## Common Q&A

### Project Narratives

**Q: What are narratives and when should they be filled out?**

A: The narratives are things to fill out by the end of June for the active projects, and to make sure that any new projects have that filled out before they close out.

---

### Consultant Fee Information

**Q: When inputting the consultant fee information in contract management, the "flip flop" of reimbursable > direct consultants fees is only for consultants that we carry under basic services, correct? A supplemental, or pass-through, consultant is considered reimbursable, right?**

A: You are correct. Really, don't just flip flop - double check your contract and put the correct values where they should go. But yes Supplemental is not direct.

**Q: But supplemental consultant costs should still be inputting on the main contract line item, right? Meaning, we don't assign a different line item for them...**

A: (This question was asked but the answer is implied by the structure - supplemental costs go on the main contract line, in the Reimbursable Consultant column.)

---

### Plan Updates - Consultants / Expenses

**Q: When updating the Plan, for Consultants / Expenses, which column are we updating for consultants? Planned Cost or ETC Cost? It looks like either column is "editable", and when you put information in 1 it autofills the other...so does it matter?**

A: (No direct answer was provided in the thread.)

---

### Contract Management Columns

**Q: Under contract management, which column should match your actual total basic services fee? Seems like it would be the Total Contract column, but in the project lifecycle #2 video it is explained that 'direct expense' column should equal your total basic services fee.**

A: I've been making sure the Total Contract column equals the overall project fee (basic services + supplemental).

**Column Breakdown:**
- **Total Contract** column = the overall project fee (basic services + supplemental)
- **Direct Consultant** column = the total of all your basic service consultant fees
- **Reimbursable Consultant** column = the total of all your supplemental service consultant fees
- **Direct Labor** column = the net Pfluger fee

**If you're using a PIF to assist:**
- VP Column "Total Contract" = PIF Reference/Cell "Total Contract Value" (Project Info Tab > Cell B42)
- VP Column "Direct Consultant" = PIF Reference/Cell "Supplemental Services" (Ajera Entry Stencil - Contract > Cell B460, or the summation of all your basic service consultant fees)
- VP Column "Reimbursable Consultant" = PIF Reference/Cell "Supplemental Services" (Project Info Tab > Cell B40)
- VP Column "Direct Labor" = Total Contract - Direct Consultant - Reimbursable Consultant (or "Pfluger Net Fee" from Project Info Tab > Cell C129)

---

### Revenue Forecasting

**Q: Very basic planning project - lump sum fee, no consultants. I went into the Revenue Forecast and saw that in the past months, the Revenue Forecasting was allocating a percentage of the fee to Reimbursables and Non-billable Items. I'm not sure that strategy will be appropriate for all projects - is there some selection we do at the beginning when creating a project that will either remove that distribution, or weight it appropriately?**

A: (No direct answer was provided in the thread.)

---

### Project Type Request

**Q: Can I make a request to have "Furniture" or "FF&E" included as a project type?**

A: (Request acknowledged and forwarded to Heather Blazi.)

---

### Removing/Replacing Resources in Labor Plan

**Q: In Plan > Labor - How do I remove a resource so I can replace them with a real person? or delete a person moving to another person?**

A: Re-assign within the Labor Plan is one way. Thinking if that is a generic, it would be better to replace vs re-assign.

**Solution:** Go to the plan > (make sure it's checked out) > hover over the person's name and look to the right for three dots > click the three dots and delete OR reassign.

---

### Expense Report Approvals

**Q: I've approved the overall expense report, but Vantagepoint is still asking for approvals of individual lines that were contained in the expense report. Is this necessary?**

A: Correct, Expense reports are line item approval. This allows project managers to approve costs for their projects. Supervisors approve non project related expenses.

---

### Viewing Draft Invoices

**Q: How can I see ALL the draft invoices for projects in my office - even the one that I am not the reviewer/approver on? Hubs > Projects > Invoices only shows the invoices that have been fully issued...not the draft ones. Hubs > Projects > Draft Invoice Approvals only shows my invoices - when I search for a specific project in that view, it says "There are no draft invoices that require your approval for this Project"**

A: The MPs have a Dashboard titled "PF Invoice Dashboard - Managing Principal" - To get to this go to the menu on the left > Dashboards > My Dashboards.

---

### Key Employee Roles Issue

**Q: Does anyone know why or how all key employee roles got wiped out? It appears this way in all the projects from what I can tell.**

A: It appears it was a glitch in the matrix. (Issue was resolved by system.)

---

### Canceled or Dead Projects

**Q: Remind me of best practices when a project is canceled (or a pursuit becomes dead) - do we change the status to "Inactive" (and in the case of a Pursuit, also change the stage to whichever term is appropriate) and that's it? Or is there something more that needs to be done?**

A: Great question! When a pursuit becomes inactive, there is a stage 15-Inactive/Did Not Pursue. You are able to move any pursuit there. If the project was entered as a lead, and you find out the lead (rumor) is not true, there's a stage 02-Dead Lead.

You do not need to change the status of the project.

If it's an active project, I believe you will need to get with accounting.

---

### Project Structure Saving Issues

**Q: I'm trying to update my project structure, and it won't let me save anything - the following window pops up saying I don't have permission to change "Approved for Use in Processing." I have not done anything to the "Approved for Use in Processing" column...I've just been adding our PM name and inserting consultants. Thoughts on what's going on?**

A: The system sometimes does this if you accidentally check then uncheck or touch the approved for use in processing box in any way. Only fix is to cancel out and start over again.

**Note:** If the error persists even after canceling and starting over without touching that column, contact Jacqueline Warner for assistance.

---

### Checked Out Plans

**Q: If a plan is checked out by someone who is no longer at Pfluger how can it get checked back in? Who do I ask to check it back in?**

A: Contact Tony Schmitz or the Vantagepoint administrator for assistance.
