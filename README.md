## Previous Handoff Notes (Jan 20, 2026)

### Pitch System - Full Database Integration

**Database Schema:**
- Created `pitches` table - All pitch submissions with P-YYYY-XXX ID format
- Created `pitch_ai_sessions` table - Stores Ezra chat history per pitch
- Created `pitch_comments` table - Human review thread with user joins
- Renamed `chat_sessions` → `repo_ai_sessions` - TheRepo RAG chats now use user_id (UUID)
- Updated `users` table - Added Dallas office, removed auth FK for dev phase

**GreenLit Pitches (New Concept):**
- GreenLit pitches are regular pitches with `status = 'greenlit'` and `user_id = null`
- Users browse available greenlit pitches and "claim" them (assigns their user_id)
- No separate greenlit_topics table - everything unified under pitches table
- 5 pre-approved pitches seeded: P-2026-001 through P-2026-005

**Services Created:**
- `pitchService.ts` - Full CRUD for pitches, AI sessions, and comments
  - `getPitches()` - Filter by user/status/availability
  - `createPitch()` - Create new pitch with auto-generated ID
  - `updatePitch()` - Update any pitch field
  - `claimPitch()` - Assign greenlit pitch to user
  - `generatePitchId()` - Auto-increment P-YYYY-XXX format
  - `savePitchAiSession()` - Persist Ezra chat to database
  - `getPitchComments()` / `addPitchComment()` - Review thread management

**UI Updates:**
- PitchSubmission.tsx - Full database integration
  - Loads pitches from Supabase on mount
  - GreenLit flow: browse → claim → appears in My Pitches
  - Custom flow: chat with Ezra → submit as pending
  - All edits auto-save to database in real-time
  - Comments persist with user attribution
- PitchChatPanel.tsx - Auto-saves Ezra conversations to `pitch_ai_sessions` table

**Data Flow:**
1. User picks GreenLit pitch → Claims it → Assigned to their user_id
2. User chats with Ezra → Pitch data extracted → Submitted as pending
3. Reviewers edit pitch fields → Auto-saves to database
4. Reviewers add comments → Saved to `pitch_comments` with user join

**Dev User:** `software@pflugerarchitects.com` (UUID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`)

### Files Changed
- `src/views/Pitch/PitchSubmission.tsx` - Complete rewrite with database persistence
- `src/components/Pitch/PitchChatPanel.tsx` - Added AI session persistence
- `src/services/pitchService.ts` - NEW: Full pitch CRUD service
- `src/services/chatHistory.ts` - Updated for user_id (UUID) and repo_ai_sessions table
- `src/views/Repo/TheRepo.tsx` - Fixed ChatSession type for userId field

---

## Previous Notes (Jan 19, 2026)

**Pitch System UI:**
- AI Pitch Assistant (Ezra) with conversational flow
- Pitch Review Dashboard with editable fields
- Combined scope + methodology dropdown
- Status controls: Pending → Revise → Green Lit

## Previous Notes (Jan 16, 2026)

**RAG improvements:**
- Section expansion: sections now act as entry points to their child content blocks
- Increased search limits: 25 blocks (was 10), 8 terms (was 5), 10 per term (was 5)
- Citations now use actual source IDs from project (e.g., `[12]` not renumbered to `[1]`)
- Only cited sources are returned (not all sources from blocks)

**Source coverage (content blocks only):**
| Project | Coverage |
|---------|----------|
| X24-RB01 | 96% |
| X25-RB01 | 78% |
| X25-RB02 | 67% |
| X25-RB03 | 100% |

### AI Research Assistant (Repository)

Conversational AI interface for exploring research findings:

**Tiered Model Architecture:**
- **Haiku** - Intent analysis, relevance checking, conversational responses
- **Sonnet** - Research synthesis with citations
- **Opus** - Deep analysis (reserved for complex queries)

**Features:**
- Full conversation history - understands context across messages
- Smart routing - determines if query needs research, clarification, or general knowledge
- Numbered citations with project attribution (e.g., `[12] X24-RB01 EyeClick...`)
- Web search fallback for topics outside our research
- Natural, conversational tone - not robotic Q&A

**Data Flow:**
1. User asks question
2. Haiku analyzes intent with conversation context
3. Search `project_blocks` table for relevant research (up to 25 blocks)
4. Haiku checks relevance of results (may pick section headers)
5. Section expansion: pull in child content blocks if section picked
6. Sonnet synthesizes answer with citations (uses actual source IDs)
7. Only cited sources returned for display

## RAG System Deep Dive

The AI research assistant uses a multi-phase approach designed for natural conversation, not robotic Q&A.

### Philosophy

Traditional RAG dumps everything it finds. Our approach:
- **Guide, don't dump** - One insight at a time, let users explore
- **Conversation, not search** - Understand context, remember what they said
- **Models shine** - No hardcoded responses, let the AI be natural

### Model Tiers

| Model | Role | When Used |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Haiku** | Intent analysis, routing, clarification | Every query (fast, cheap) |
| **Sonnet** | Research synthesis with citations | When we have relevant research |
| **Opus** | Deep analysis, complex connections | Reserved for heavy lifting |

### Phase 0: Intent Analysis (Haiku)

Before searching, Haiku analyzes the query with full conversation context:

```
Analyze this conversation in the context of architectural design research.

Recent conversation:
user: ideas for a special needs school?
assistant: [previous response]
user: we have a new project, large site

Current message: "what about the site"

Our research covers: acoustics, lighting, daylight, color, biophilic design,
nature, emotional regulation, sanctuary spaces, child development,
learning environments, materials, sensory design

Respond with JSON:
{
  "topic": "main topic based on full conversation context",
  "intent": "research_query" | "conversational" | "general_design",
  "searchTerms": ["terms", "to", "search"],
  "relatedTopics": ["related topics from our list"],
  "contextSummary": "brief summary of what user is exploring"
}
```

**Intent types:**
- `research_query` - Question about design, or user sharing project context
- `conversational` - Greetings, thanks, very short replies needing clarification
- `general_design` - Design question likely outside our specific research

**Key insight**: "we have a new project, large site" is project context, not just a short reply. The prompt explicitly handles this.

### Phase 1: Relevance Check (Haiku)

After searching `project_blocks`, Haiku checks if results actually answer the question:

```
You are a research relevance checker. Given a user question and research
block summaries, determine which blocks are relevant.

User Question: "what about the site"

Research Blocks:
[{ id, summary, conclusions }...]

Respond with JSON:
{"relevant": true, "relevantBlockIds": ["id1"], "reasoning": "Brief explanation"}

Only include blocks that directly help answer the question.
```

If not relevant, we generate a clarifying response instead of forcing bad results.

### Phase 2: Conversational Response (Haiku)

When we need to clarify, redirect, or don't have research, Haiku generates a natural response:

```
You're a research assistant at Pfluger Architects chatting with someone
exploring design ideas. Respond naturally and helpfully.

Recent conversation:
[last 4 messages]

Their latest message: "not sure"

Context:
- They seem interested in: special needs school design
- Working on a new project with a large site
- Our research covers: [topics]
- Related topics we have: emotional regulation, sensory design
- We don't have specific research on their exact question

Respond conversationally (1-3 sentences). Acknowledge their interest and
gently steer toward topics we can help with, or offer general thoughts.
```

**No hardcoded fallbacks** - Every response is generated, maintaining natural voice.

### Phase 3: Research Synthesis (Sonnet)

When we have relevant research, Sonnet synthesizes with full conversation context:

```
You're chatting with someone exploring design research at Pfluger Architects.
Be genuinely curious and helpful - like a knowledgeable colleague, not a
search engine.

Conversation so far:
user: ideas for a special needs school?
assistant: [previous response]
user: we have a new project, large site
user: what about outdoor spaces?

Their current question: "what about outdoor spaces?"

VOICE:
- Natural, warm, curious
- Share what's interesting about what you found
- Make connections they might not have considered
- Reference earlier parts of the conversation if relevant

STRUCTURE (flexible, not rigid):
- Share one compelling insight from the research (cite using source ID like [12], [13])
- Mention the project naturally (X25-RB01)
- Connect to what they've shared about their project/interests
- Keep it conversational - 2-4 sentences total

AVOID:
- Bullet points, headers, lists
- "Based on research..." or "According to..."
- Ignoring context from the conversation
- Sounding like a report

Research Content:
[blocks with searchable_text, conclusions, source_ids]

Available Sources (use these exact IDs when citing):
[12] EyeClick. EyeClick Games Library
[13] Kids Jump Tech. Kids Jump Tech Products
```

### Voice & Tone Guidelines

**What we want:**
- Colleague sharing something interesting they found
- Curious about what the user is working on
- Makes connections they might not see
- Guides exploration, doesn't lecture

**What we avoid:**
- "Based on research..." / "According to studies..."
- Bullet point dumps
- Every response ending with a question
- Clinical, report-style language
- Ignoring what they've already told us

**Example good response:**
> That's interesting you're working on a large site - from the X25-RB01 sanctuary spaces research, one thing that stood out is how children's wayfinding changes dramatically with scale. Younger kids can feel genuinely lost in expansive spaces, which affects their sense of safety before they even get to the classroom [3]. Are you thinking about how to break down the scale, or is there flexibility in the site layout?

**Example bad response:**
> Based on our research, large sites present several considerations:
> - Wayfinding challenges for younger students
> - Scale can impact sense of safety
> - Outdoor spaces should be appropriately sized
>
> Would you like to know more about any of these topics?

### Citation System

1. Sonnet is given actual source IDs: `[12] EyeClick`, `[13] Kids Jump Tech`
2. Sonnet cites using those real IDs: `[12]`, `[13]`
3. After synthesis, we extract which IDs were cited
4. Filter sources to only those actually cited
5. Display shows: `[12] X24-RB01 EyeClick. EyeClick Games Library`

**Note:** Citation numbers now match the project's sources block, so `[12]` in the chat corresponds to source 12 on the project page.

### Conversation History

- Last 4 messages passed to intent analysis
- Last 6 messages passed to synthesis
- Enables understanding "the site" refers to earlier context
- Allows natural conversation flow without repeating context

### Web Search Fallback

When we don't have research on a topic:
1. Call `web-search` Edge Function
2. Sonnet generates general knowledge response
3. Gently nudge toward related topics we DO have

Edge Function uses Sonnet to answer general design questions, keeping the same conversational voice.

### Research Topics We Cover

The system knows our research areas for smart routing:
- Acoustics
- Lighting / Daylight
- Color psychology
- Biophilic design / Nature
- Emotional regulation
- Sanctuary spaces
- Child development
- Learning environments
- Materials
- Sensory design

Queries outside these areas get web search + redirection.

### Research Campus Map

- Floating glassmorphism sidebar
- Projects organized by office (Austin, Corpus Christi, etc.)
- Search functionality
- Project detail panel with dashboard links

### Team

- Alexander Wickes, RA, LEED BD+C - Design Performance Leader, Research
- Christian Owens, AIA - Director of Design
- Brenda Swirczynski, MSc, ALEP - Education Facilities Planner

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` with:

```bash
# Supabase
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Anthropic (for local development - production uses Edge Function secrets)
VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Supabase Edge Functions need `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in the dashboard secrets.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

```bash
npm run build
wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=pfluger-the-repo
```

**URLs:**
- Production: `https://repository.pflugerarchitects.com`
- Preview: `https://pfluger-the-repo-67g.pages.dev`

**Note:** The `public/_redirects` file ensures all routes redirect to `index.html` for React Router client-side routing.

**How Authentication Works:**
1. User logs in with email/password (validated against `AuthContext.tsx`)
2. System looks up user by email in Supabase `users` table
3. If found, user's UUID is used to assign/filter pitches
4. If NOT found, user can log in but cannot submit pitches (will see error)

**Adding New Users:**
1. Add credentials to `VALID_USERS` array in `src/components/System/AuthContext.tsx`
2. Insert matching row in Supabase `users` table:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, email, name, role, office) VALUES
('your-uuid-here', 'email@pflugerarchitects.com', 'Full Name', 'researcher', 'Austin');
```

**Current Implementation:**
- Hardcoded credentials in `AuthContext.tsx`
- localStorage-based session persistence
- Two-tier permissions: Admin/Researcher (requires login) vs Viewer (public)
- Viewer role = default logged-out state (no credentials needed)

**Role Permissions:**
- **Admin** - Full access to all pitches across all users, review dashboard, system management
- **Researcher** - Submit and manage own pitches only, claim greenlit opportunities, view all projects
- **Viewer** - Public read-only access to Campus, Explore, Connect, About (no login required)

*Note: Designed for future migration to Azure SSO (Microsoft Entra ID). Architecture supports federated authentication with minimal refactoring.*

## Block System

Project dashboards use a composable block system. Blocks are stored in the Supabase `project_blocks` table and fetched dynamically when a project is opened.

**Architecture:**
- Project metadata (title, researcher, etc.) stored in `src/services/projects.ts`
- Block content stored in Supabase `project_blocks` table
- `DynamicProjectDashboard` fetches blocks on demand with loading state
- Images served from Supabase Storage bucket

**Database Stats (as of Jan 2026):**
- 182 blocks across 8 projects
- RAG-searchable with summary, tags, and searchable_text fields

### Available Blocks (21 types)

| Block | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `section` | Section divider with title and optional source refs |
| `text-content` | Markdown-like text with headers, bullets, bold |
| `stat-grid` | Grid of key metrics with trends |
| `key-findings` | Icon-based findings cards |
| `bar-chart` | Horizontal bars (simple, grouped, multi-bar) |
| `donut-chart` | Circular chart with center label |
| `comparison-table` | Side-by-side feature comparison |
| `image-gallery` | Responsive image grid with lightbox |
| `timeline` | Project timeline (horizontal/vertical) |
| `workflow-steps` | Process steps with findings/deliverables |
| `case-study-card` | Scrollable project cards with detail modals |
| `tool-comparison` | Rating rings with pros/cons |
| `scenario-bar-chart` | Cost scenario comparison |
| `cost-builder` | Interactive budget builder with toggles |
| `survey-rating` | 1-5 star rating distribution |
| `feedback-summary` | Positive/negative theme analysis |
| `quotes` | Testimonial cards |
| `activity-rings` | Apple-style concentric rings |
| `product-options` | Product lines with pricing/specs |
| `sources` | Citation list |

### Creating a Project Dashboard

See `docs/Adding-a-New-Project.md` for the full guide including database schema, all 21 block type JSON schemas, and a complete SQL template.

**Quick steps:**
1. Add project metadata to `src/services/projects.ts` in `PROJECT_METADATA`
2. Insert blocks into Supabase `project_blocks` table with:
   - `id`: Unique block ID (e.g., "section-overview")
   - `project_id`: Project ID (e.g., "X25-RB01")
   - `block_type`: One of the 21 block types
   - `block_order`: Sequential order (1, 2, 3...)
   - `data`: Block-specific JSON content
   - Optional RAG fields: `summary`, `tags`, `searchable_text`
3. Upload images to Supabase Storage bucket: `Repository Bucket/projects/[project-folder]/`
4. Add to `PROJECTS_WITH_DASHBOARDS` in Portfolio.tsx
